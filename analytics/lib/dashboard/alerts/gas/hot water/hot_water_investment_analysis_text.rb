        Hot water in schools is generally provided by a central gas boiler which
        then continuously circulates the hot water in a loop around the school.
        Sometimes these gas-based systems are supplemented by more local
        electrically powered immersion or point of use heaters.

    %{
      <p>
        These systems are inefficient because they circulate hot water permanently
        in a loop around the school so hot water is immediately available when
        someone turns on a tap rather than having to wait for the hot water to come
        all the way from the boiler room. The circulatory pipework used to do this
        is often poorly insulated and loses heat. Often these types of systems are
        only 15% efficient compared with direct point of use water heaters which
        are often over 90% efficient. Replacing the pipework insulation is generally
        not a cost-efficient investment.

        school hours and turning it off during weekends and holidays will save you
        about <%= better_boiler_control_£_saving_html %> year and reduce your carbon

          The &apos;Point of use electric heater&apos; option,
          typically leads to the largest savings,
          perhaps <%= point_of_use_electric_£_saving_html %> per year for your school,

          (<%= point_of_use_electric_co2_saving_kg_html %>/

          The calculation for &apos;Point of use electric heater&apos; for your

          Energy Sparks might not have enough information
          e.g. you already have point of use electric hot water, to accurately
