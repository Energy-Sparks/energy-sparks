      <h3>Assessment of seasonal variation in baseload:</h3>
      <p>
        Your out of hours baseload usage shouldn't really vary signifcantly between
        seasons; you shouldn't be consuming more electricity overnight in the
        winter than in the summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your school has signifcant variation in consumption between seasons you
        will need to do some detective work in your school to try to find out
        why and to remedy the situation. What is turned on overnight in the winter
        which is not turned on in the summer? Does it need to be turned on, and if so
        could a timer be fitted to ensure it is not on overnight and at weekends?
      </p>
