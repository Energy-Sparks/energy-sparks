        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            This is a statistical process which Energy Sparks uses to try to model the
            heating energy consumption of a school, using regression modelling
            techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the winter, building gas consumption goes linearly as it gets
            colder. In a thermostatically well controlled building the daily heating
            gas consumption should be proportional to the difference between the inside
            and outside temperatures. So, if the building's internal temperature was
            20C, you would expect twice as much gas to be used on a day when it is 0C
            outside compared with a day when its 10C outside, as the temperature
            difference (20C = 20C - 0C) is double on the colder day (compared with 10C
            = 20C - 10C).
        </p>
        <p>
            The modelling is subsequently used for:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Adjusting/normalising gas consumption for outside temperature, so
                comparisons can be made between differing days
            </li>
            <li>
                Calculating missing data - the Smart Meter data fed to Energy Sparks
                often has gaps, which we need to fill in, by finding days with similar
                temperatures where the data isn't missing, and then using the model to
                calculate the theoretical gas consumption for the missing day using that
                day's temperature data
            </li>
            <li>
                Estimating the potential reduced gas consumption from reducing the
                school's internal temperature&#47;thermostat settings
            </li>
            <li>
                Providing feedback via alerts on the quality of the thermostatic
                control R2), number of days in the year the heating is on, significant
                (temperature compensated) changes in gas consumption

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
            The process involves:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Trying to identify periods when the heating is on or off:

            <ol type="a">
              <li>
                  Which starts by looking at the summer gas consumption when you would
                  assume gas is just being used for hot water and in the kitchen
              </li>
              <li>
                  Statistically modelling the distribution of this consumption
              </li>
              <li>
                  Inferring from this modelling when the heating is on (i.e. if the gas
                  consumption is significantly outside this distribution)
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Then calculating the regression models:

            <ol type="1">
              <li>
                  Splitting the last year of daily consumption (kWh) into 7 categories -
                  school days, weekends, holidays times heating on, hot water and kitchen on
                  only, plus nothing on
              </li>
              <li>
                  Doing regression calculations on each of those categorised groups of
                  days, to calculate the linear relationship between outside temperature and
                  gas consumption
              </li>
              <li>
                  Repeating 2. Above, but with the school heating days split into
                  different days of the week; some buildings are thermally massive, and take
                  several days to heat up- so the gas consumption on a Monday (higher), is
                  different from that of a Friday (lower) for example
              </li>
              <li>
                  Statistically comparing the modelling produced in 2 and 3 with the real
                  daily consumption (CUSUM space), and determining which of 2 or 3 is the
                  best modelling to use for the advice provided by Energy Sparks
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This calculation takes place every day, using the latest year's worth of

        <h2>
          Separating heating and non-heating days
        </h2>
        <p>
          The first stage of the modelling process is to try to separate heating
          and non-heating days. This is because the regression modelling for
          heating and non-heating days is quite different. This separation allows
          different regresison models to be applied to the 2 modes of gas/storage
          heater consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process is difficult to automate as the data is often messy, so
          sometimes the automatically modelling needs to be manually overwritten
          by a meter attribute. This often occurs where there is no clear distinction
          between days when the heating is on and off:
          <ul>
            <li>
                sometimes if the heating is left on all year it can be difficult to understand
                what is going on at a school, and impossible to identiy whether the heating
                has ever been turned off. This gets more difficult the further north you
                go where you would expect longer heating seasons.
            </li>
            <li>
                where a school has very good thermostatic control, or working daytime setback
                (the boiler turns off when the outside temperature for example reaches 15C),
                there is not an abrupt drop in energy consumption which is what the modelling
                is looking for to determine what is a heating and what is a non-heating day
            </li>
            <li>
                where a school has very poor thermostatic control, where there is limited relationship
                between the outside temperature and daily heating energy consumption
            </li>
            <li>
              where the building manager occasionally turns off the heating half way through the school
              day in mild weather
            </li>
            <li>
              where there has been a substantial change in heating or hot water control or a new boiler
              half way through the most recent year - as happened ata number of schools between March 2020
              and August 2020 due to COVID
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        The process starts by sampling daily gas or storage heater consumption during the summer in June,
        July and August. It assumes the heating is off during these months and then models this
        daily consumption calculating the standard devation of this data, to imply a range of
        daily consumption for daily heating days, and then assumes any consumption above this
        range is a &quot;heating&quot; day.

            Once Energy Sparks has calculated both models - the simple one where all
            days of the week are treated equally, and the 'thermally massive' model
            where the days of the week are dealt with separately, it then makes a
            decision on how close each of the models fits to the real data. By comparing
            the average R2 figures, and the percent standard deviation of the CUSUM.

              Given the '<%= best_model.name %>' model produced a better fit (higher R2, lower standard

              Ideally there shouldn't be too many holidays with the heating on, and the

              might come on at an outside temperature of between 4C and 8C, but only on
              enough to increase the internal temperature of the building 10C, not the
              full occupancy temperature of 20C. So, in this circumstance, you might only

              and these points might be about half of the values winter school days, to
