# Service responsible for carrying out the data "validation" and "aggregation" processes
# for a +MeterCollection+
#
# The "validation" process involves applying a set of data quality checks and validation
# rules to each meter in the collection. This involves, e.g. substituting for missing or
# bad data. The is delegated to the +ValidateAMRData+ class.
#
# The "aggregation" process involves a variety of steps, including:
#
# - creating new "virtual" meters that hold derived data
#   e.g. solar import/export/self-consumption values)
#
# - creating one ore more "aggregate" meters that combine the individual time-series
#   for each real and virtual meter into a combined series that describes consumption
#   for the whole school.
#
# - processing tariff data so that it can be efficiently applied at runtime
#
# There are various configuration options that can guide this process, e.g. rules
# for combining together meter data, as well configuration that drives individual
# steps (e.g. tariffs, solar panel configuration, etc)
#
# The results of both processes involve modifications to the +MeterCollection+, e.g.
# adding new +Meter+ objects or modifying existing data.
#
# This is a CPU intensive process so generally we aim to cache the results
