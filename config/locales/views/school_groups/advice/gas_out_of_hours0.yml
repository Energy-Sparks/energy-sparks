                The following table summarises how we have benchmarked each school in your group according to its

                "Exemplar" schools are in the top 17.5% on Energy Sparks. "Well managed" schools are in the top
                30% of schools.

                The savings for each school are based on reducing their use to match those of an Exemplar school
                with similar characteristics.
