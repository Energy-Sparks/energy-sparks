          <p>
            Our analysis takes into account a range of characteristics for each school, including its floor area, location, pupil numbers and type.

          <p>
          This table summarises recent use based on the latest available data for each school.
          </p>
          <p>"<strong>Last week</strong>" reports on the latest full week of data. Change in
          use is measured against the previous week.</p>
          <p>"<strong>Last month</strong>" reports on the last full calendar month of data. Change in
          use is measured against the same month last year.</p>
          <p>"<strong>Last year</strong>" reports on the last 12 months of data (365 days) for the school. Change in
          use is measured against previous 12 months period. This is a rolling 12 month period rather than calendar or
          academic years.</p>
          <p>A dash ("-") indicates that we do not have enough recent data to report on that period.</p>
          <p>"n/a" indicates that we don't have enough historical data in order to do a comparison.</p>
