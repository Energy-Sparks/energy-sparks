                Schools are benchmarked with comparable schools based on several key characteristics including floor area,
                location, pupil numbers and type.
                </p>
                <p>
                The following table summarises how we have benchmarked each school in your group according to its
                long term gas use.</p>
                <p>
                "Exemplar" schools are in the top 17.5% on Energy Sparks. "Well managed" schools are in the top
                30% of schools.
                </p>
                <p>
                The savings for each school are based on reducing their use to match those of an Exemplar school
                with similar characteristics.
