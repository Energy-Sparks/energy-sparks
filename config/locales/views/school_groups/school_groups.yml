          Understanding how a school's energy use matches up with other schools of a similar size and how much energy could be saved each year is a good place to start.
          </p>
          <p>
          These savings are based on comparing electricity usage over the last 12 months against the best performing schools.

        alert_electricity_baseload_versus_benchmark_html: |-
          <p>
            Electricity baseload is the electricity needed to provide power to appliances that keep running at all times.
            It can be the fastest way of reducing a school's energy costs and reducing its carbon footprint.
          </p>
          <p>
           These figures represent a comparison of school baseload over the last 12 months against the best performing schools.

        alert_electricity_peak_kw_versus_benchmark_html: |-
          <p>
          Electricity use varies at different times of the day. Usage will be at a peak in the middle of the day, but should be low overnight.

          Getting the heating control right for your schools can save money and carbon very quickly as well as improving the learning environment for students.
          </p>
          <p>
          These savings are based on changing the average morning start time for heating in each school. So that the heating comes on later each day to minimise waste outside of school hours.
          </p>
        alert_heating_sensitivity_advice_html: |-
          <p>
            Even the best performing schools can reduce energy usage by turning down the heating.

        alert_out_of_hours_electricity_usage_html: |-
          <p>
            Out of hours electricity use is the amount of electricity used when the school is closed - overnight, at weekends and during the holidays. Reducing out of hours electricity use is one of the easiest, and cheapest ways of saving
            lots of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            These figures are based on a comparison of electricity usage outside of school hours against the best performing
            schools. Ensuring that school opening hours are up to date will improve the accuracy of the analysis.

            Turning the boiler off in warm weather, for example earlier in the spring and later in the winter, can
            reduce gas usage.
          </p>
          <p>
            These savings are based on our analysis of when the heating has been on in schools during warm weather.

        alert_solar_pv_benefit_estimator_html: |-
          <p>
          Solar PV works well at schools as peak output from the panels around midday coincides with peak consumption at your school. Schools are now seeing a return on their investment within five to ten years.
          </p>
          <p>
          These savings are based on the estimated annual savings in energy use if solar panels were installed in these schools. Savings do not include capital costs. View the analysis for individual schools for more information on our estimates, including capital costs and payback periods.

        alert_thermostatic_control_html: |-
          <p>
            A building with good thermostatic control means that the colder it is outside the higher the gas consumption for heating.
          </p>
          <p>
            These savings are based on improving the thermostatic control in schools, to use less gas when the weather is warmer. This
            could be by checking thermostats or configuring weather compensation settings on boilers.

          The following table provides a summary of your consumptions and emissions for the last academic year (%{start_date} to %{end_date}). Consumption is based on the latest data available to Energy Sparks, which may not be completed. Emissions are calculated using the latest carbon emission factors which are quoted below.
          </p>
          <p>
          We do not recommend including these figures in your SECR reporting without first confirming that Energy Sparks has access to data for all of your schools and meters in each school.
