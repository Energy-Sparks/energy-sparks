          Understanding how a school's energy use matches up with other schools of a similar size and how much energy could be saved each year is a good place to start.

          <p>
            Electricity baseload is the electricity needed to provide power to appliances that keep running at all times.
            It can be the fastest way of reducing a school's energy costs and reducing its carbon footprint.

          These savings are based on changing the average morning start time for heating in each school. So that the heating comes on later each day to minimise waste outside of school hours.

            lots of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            These figures are based on a comparison of electricity usage outside of school hours against the best performing
            schools. Ensuring that school opening hours are up to date will improve the accuracy of the analysis.

          Solar PV works well at schools as peak output from the panels around midday coincides with peak consumption at your school. Schools are now seeing a return on their investment within five to ten years.
          </p>
          <p>
          These savings are based on the estimated annual savings in energy use if solar panels were installed in these schools. Savings do not include capital costs. View the analysis for individual schools for more information on our estimates, including capital costs and payback periods.

          <p>
            A building with good thermostatic control means that the colder it is outside the higher the gas consumption for heating.
          </p>
          <p>
            These savings are based on improving the thermostatic control in schools, to use less gas when the weather is warmer. This
            could be by checking thermostats or configuring weather compensation settings on boilers.

          <h3>How to identify and fill gaps in data</h3>
          <p>Data downloaded from Energy Sparks cannot cover all SECR reporting requirements. For example:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Energy Sparks includes only gas and electricity data, we are unable to present consumption data for
          alternative fuels such as oil or biomass.</li>
          <li>Energy Sparks does not include energy data for transport or other activities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          There are likely to be additional gaps in data, so you should review available data in Energy Sparks and obtain
          data via energy bills or other internal reporting processes to fill these gaps. For example:
          <ul>
          <li>Energy Sparks may not cover all schools within the MAT</li>
          <li>Energy Sparks may not have access to data for all meters at all schools</li>
          <li>There may be gaps in the reporting period - for example due to faulty meters</li>
          <li>For some months, the data quality may be low due to meter issues or estimated consumption received from your energy supplier.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
          The Data tab contains CSV downloads of all available data for your schools on a monthly basis. Each month, a
          quality code is given to the data to show whether it is complete or not.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you update any monthly figures or fill any gaps, don’t forget to update the consumption totals and
          recalculate emissions data.

          <h3>How to improve this process in the future</h3>
          <p>
          This Energy Sparks tool is designed to support someone who has not compiled data for SECR reporting before.
          Information here should make the process easier, reducing the need to collect information from your energy
          bills. However, you will be able to compile your SECR report more quickly in future if consumption figures are collected from schools each month and recorded centrally.

          <h3>Purpose of this tool</h3>
          <p>
          Multi-Academy Trusts consuming more than a set amount of energy are required to report their energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions. For more detail, see <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/streamlined-energy-and-carbon-reporting-secr-for-academy-trusts/streamlined-energy-and-carbon-reporting-secr-for-academy-trusts\">Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR)
          for academy trusts - GOV.UK</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
          Energy Sparks provides a unique repository of energy data for MATs, and presents an opportunity to reduce the effort required by MAT staff in compiling their SECR reports. However, your Energy Sparks dataset will not always cover all energy data required. For example, we may not include all of your schools; some schools may have meters  that aren’t capable of sending data to us; or there may be gaps in some of the reported energy
          data.
          </p>
          <p>The information below should support you to identify and fill any gaps.</p>
        what_is_included_html: |-
          <h3>What is included in the report?</h3>
          <p>
          The Data tab includes gas and electricity consumption, conversion factors and related emissions data in a
          format compatible with SECR reporting. However you will need to check that it is complete and add any other
          required data.
