          <p>
            Electricity baseload is the electricity needed to provide power to appliances that keep running at all times.
            It can be the fastest way of reducing a school's energy costs and reducing its carbon footprint.

          <p>
          Electricity use varies at different times of the day. Usage will be at a peak in the middle of the day, but should be low overnight.
          </p>
          <p>
          These figures represent a comparison of usage at peak times against the best performing schools.

        alert_heating_coming_on_too_early_html: |-
          <p>
          These savings are based on changing the average morning start time for heating in each school. So that the
          heating comes on later each day to minimise waste outside of school hours.
          </p>
          <p>
          Getting the heating control right for your schools can save money and carbon very quickly as well as improving the learning environment for students.

        alert_heating_sensitivity_advice_html: |-
          <p>
            Even the best performing schools can reduce energy usage by turning down the heating.

        alert_out_of_hours_electricity_usage_html: |-
          <p>
            Out of hours electricity use is the amount of electricity used when the school is closed - overnight, at weekends and during the holidays. Reducing out of hours electricity use is one of the easiest, and cheapest ways of saving
            lots of energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            These figures are based on a comparison of electricity usage outside of school hours against the best performing
            schools. Ensuring that school opening hours are up to date will improve the accuracy of the analysis.

          <p>
            Turning the boiler off in warm weather, for example earlier in the Spring and later in the Winter, can
            reduce gas usage.
          </p>
          <p>
            These savings are based on our analysis of when the heating has been on in schools during warm weather.

        alert_solar_pv_benefit_estimator_html: |-
          <p>
          These savings are based on the estimated annual savings in energy use if solar panels were installed in these schools.
          </p>
          <p>
          The savings do not include capital costs. View the analysis for individual schools for more information on our estimates.

        alert_thermostatic_control_html: |-
          <p>
            A building with good thermostatic control means that the colder it is outside the higher the gas consumption for heating.
          </p>
          <p>
            These savings are based on improving the thermostatic control in schools, to use less gas when the weather is warmer. This
            can checking thermostats or configuring weather compensation settings on boilers.
