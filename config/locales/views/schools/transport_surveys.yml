            <li>This can be carried out by a group of pupils with ipads or tablets at the school gate or by a teacher at registration time</li>
            <li>Click "Launch survey app" and then select today's weather</li>
            <li>Once the app is launched you can go out of WiFi range, so you can survey pupils arriving at the school gate</li>
            <li>Ask members of the school community the questions presented in the survey. Park and Stride should be ticked if pupils are dropped off at least %{park_and_stride_mins} minutes walk from school and walk the last part of their journey</li>
            <li>When you have finished, make sure you are connected to the internet before submitting the results</li>
            <li>You could try conducting a transport survey on a different day to see if you have reduced your carbon</li>

          why: Transport accounts for around one-fifth of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Some modes of transport, emit more carbon than others! For example, petrol or diesel cars emit, on average, about 3 times more than electric cars. Some modes emit no carbon whatsoever - can you guess what they are?
