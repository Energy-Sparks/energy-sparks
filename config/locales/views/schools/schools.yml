        <p>We have limited energy data for your school. To allow you to set targets to reduce your energy use you can use this form to provide historical usage data. You will need to check either your monthly bill or your energy supplier portal and then provide the total kWh used for each month.</p>
        <p>If we are later able to get access to historical half-hourly readings from your energy supplier then we will automatically use these instead.</p>

      without_target: To show historical progress towards reducing your energy use, we need at least 13 months of historical readings.

        title: School opening hours
      message_1: Enter the times when the pupils are arriving and leaving the school. This should be when the school is fully operational with the majority of pupils in school.
      message_1_community_use: Before and after school clubs can be included if the majority of the school is in use by pupils. External lettings or times when you have only a small proportion of your school estate in use by pupils should be listed under community use times below.
      message_2: Many schools will have cleaning or other premises staff in the school outside of the times when they are open to pupils. Do not include these periods in your main school opening hours as we recommend that you should keep energy use to a minimum during these times.
      message_3: Times should be entered in 24 hour format.
