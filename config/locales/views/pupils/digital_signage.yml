          <p>Many schools use digital signage to make information available to staff, students and visitors.</p>
          <p>Energy Sparks provides some options for displaying aspects of your energy analysis within a digital signage
          system like TriplePlay.</p>
          <p>The links below provide access to dedicated web pages that display:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a random energy equivalence, that puts energy use into context</li>
            <li>charts that summarise recent energy use, and a comparison of energy use during school hours, holidays
            and weekend</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We have provided several options to allow you to choose what information will be displayed</p>
          <p>The pages are formatted for display on panels, e.g. installed in public areas or classrooms. They can be
          used in any digital signage system capable of displaying or embedding a web page. But your system must support
          fetching content, data and javascript directly from our website.</p>
          <p>The pages do not automatically update so are best incorporated into an existing carousel of content or
          a regularly refreshing display.</p>
          <p>If you have questions about using this feature then please contact us at
          <a href='mailto:support@energysparks.uk'>support@energysparks.uk</a></p>
        prompt:
          link_text: Get in touch
          text: If you would like support in testing out how you can incorporate our analysis into your digital signage, or have any questions or feedback then please get in touch. Our aim is to ensure this feature works with a range of different digital signage systems.

          <p>Our digital signage feature is currently only available to schools that are publicly sharing their analysis
          via their pupil and adult dashboards.</p>
          <p>Please <a href='mailto:hello@energysparks.uk'>get in touch</a> if you would like to revise your data sharing
          setting. Or are interested in discussing how we might be able to extend this feature to support schools with more
          limited data sharing options.</p>

              <p>The links below allow you to download a complete list of URLs for the schools in your group that are publicly
              sharing their analysis. These are intended
              to help setting up displays if the digital signage system is managed centrally within a MAT or
              Local Authority</p>
              <p>If individual schools are responsible for their own signage then please refer to the school-specific pages.
              These can be accessed from the "Manage School" menu when viewing a school dashboard.</p>
