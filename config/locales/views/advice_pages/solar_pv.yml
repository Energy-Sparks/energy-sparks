            <p>Many schools have solar photovoltaic (solar PV) panels which produce energy from sunlight.</p>
            <p>The panels reduce both the school's electricity consumption from the national grid and its carbon emissions. Electricity produced from solar panels produces very little carbon.</p>
            <p>Solar PV works well for schools as they produce most energy around midday which is when a school typically uses most energy.</p>

              <li>The calculations currently assume you will get some income from any exported electricity. Since the end of the Feed-In-Tariff in April 2019 automatic income from export has been replaced by the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) scheme but this income is dependent on agreement with your electricity supplier</li>
              <li>The calculations are based on a current electricity price of 15p/kWh, if mains electricity prices increase there will be a higher economic benefit and shorter payback to the installation.</li>
              <li>If the school becomes more efficient at using electricity and reduces its electricity consumption the benefit will also reduce.</li>
              <li>The capital costs in the table above are estimates based on current market rates; the installation cost at your school might be a little different - you need to get quotes.</li>
              <li>The estimates assume your have roof space and that is it roughly south facing - as this is optimal for schools whose peak demand is during the middle of the day when south facing panels produce the most electricity.</li>
              <li>The benefits of your solar pv will be reduced if you make your school more energy efficient. However, if you want your school to reduce its carbon emissions you should consider both installing solar panels and reducing your electricity consumption.</li>
            </ul>
          energy_sparks_has_estimated: Energy Sparks has estimated that installing %{optimum_kwp} kWp provides the best payback
          however_installing_slightly_more: However, installing slightly more or less than the best payback makes little difference to the economics
          installing_solar_pv: Installing solar PV at your school will reduce the electricity you consume from the national grid, and reduce your school's carbon emissions. It should be seen as an addition to reducing your school's electricity consumption through energy efficiency rather than an alternative
          it_might_take_between: It might take between 2 and 15 years to pay back the capital costs of installing solar panels depending on your assumptions for future electricity tariffs, but PTAs will often be prepared to raise some of the capital costs making it more economic for schools

              <li>Speak with a specialist who can assess the existing roof space in terms of space available and structural integrity.</li>
              <li>You can ask for specialist advice from qualified installers listed on the MCS website.
              <li>Investigate funding sources for solar panels.</li>
