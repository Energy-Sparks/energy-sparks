        hot_water_efficiency_improvement_options_content_html: |-
          <p>Circulatory hot water systems are inefficient because they circulate hot water permanently in a loop around the school so hot water is immediately available when someone turns on a tap rather than having to wait for the hot water to come all the way from the boiler room. The circulatory pipework used to do this is often poorly insulated and loses heat. Often these types of systems are only 15% efficient.</p>
          <p>Generally, there are two potential options you might have to reduce the costs and carbon emissions of running the hot water system at your school:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>improving the timing control of your existing system or</li>
            <li>replacing it with point of use electric water heaters.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The table below provides some indication of the benefits of these two alternatives:</p>

          <p>Improving the timing control of your existing hot water system or replacing it completely with point of use electric hot water systems can produce significant savings.</p>
          <p>Hot water in schools is generally provided by a central gas boiler which then continuously circulates the hot water in a loop around the school. Sometimes these gas-based systems are supplemented by more local electrically powered immersion or point of use heaters.</p>
        hot_water_efficiency_improvement_options_table_footer_html: "<p>This is only an approximate estimate as Energy Sparks can only imply this based on a generic school of the same size as yours and the information provided by your school's smart meter data, but it should provide an indication whether investments of this type are worthwhile investigating further.</p>"
        how_does_energy_sparks_calculate: How does Energy Sparks calculate the efficiency and potential savings of a school’s hot water system?
        how_does_energy_sparks_calculate_content_introduction_html: |-
          <p>We estimate the amount of energy used for hot water in your school by looking at heating over the course of the summer - just before and during the start of the summer holidays. It is assumed that during the summer term, gas is used for hot water but not space heating and during the holidays, gas is used for hot water but very little of that is used.</p>
          <p>The chart below gives a demonstration of that assessment for your school. The red bars show energy used to heat the water that is circulated around the school. The blue bars show the energy used to heat the water that is used. Note that if your school has a gas heated swimming pool, it is more difficult for us to assess efficiency.</p>
        improved_boiler_control_content_html: |-
          <p>This option involves changing the timing of your existing boiler potentially at no cost to the school.</p>
          <p>
            It involves reducing the time the hot water is heated to school hours and turning it off during weekends and holidays.
            This could save you about %{gas_better_control_saving_gbp} a year and reduce your carbon emissions
            by %{gas_better_control_saving_co2} kg CO2 (%{gas_better_control_saving_co2_percent}).

          <p>This option often leads to the largest savings but for most schools it does require a significant capital investment.</p>

            We estimate a saving of %{point_of_use_electric_saving_gbp} per year for your school, and a more significant
            reduction in carbon emissions of (%{point_of_use_electric_saving_co2} kg CO2/ %{point_of_use_electric_saving_co2_percent}).

            Theoretically every pupil uses about 5 litres of hot water per day, which for your school with %{number_of_pupils} pupils,
            equates to %{theoretical_annual_hot_water_requirement_litres} litres of hot water over the 190 days of the school year. In a 100% efficient system
            about %{theoretical_annual_hot_water_requirement_kwh} kWh of energy is required each year to heat this hot water.

          Improving the way that you control your hot water could reduce your annual gas consumption by %{gas_better_control_saving_kwh_percent}
          or you could investigate replacing your current hot water system with point of use electric heaters which would save

        next_steps_html: |-
          To reduce the amount of energy used to heat water in your school:
          <ul>
            <li>Make sure any immersion heaters are only set to run from 8am to 3pm. If storage tanks are large you might find you can turn off the immersion heater at 2pm or earlier and still have enough hot water left for the rest of the school day and for cleaners after school.</li>
            <li>Check your hot water is switched off at the weekend and during school holidays. You may need to change from 24 hour timers to 7 day timers to achieve this reliably, but it can be an easy way to save lots of energy.</li>
            <li>Adjust gas and oil boiler controls so that hot water is only heated Monday to Friday in term time.</li>
            <li>If your heating system boilers also provide hot water in the summer, ensure that the minimum number of boilers operate for hot water provision and that all heating system pumps are switched off and valves closed.</li>
            <li>Tanks and their distribution pipework should be well insulated to avoid heat loss.</li>
            <li>Wasting hot water penalises a school twice: once for the energy used to heat the water and again for the actual water used. Fit taps which turn off automatically and deal with dripping taps and leaks promptly.</li>
            <li>Consider providing cleaning staff with point-of-use electric water heaters for use during holidays.</li>
            <li>Consider moving to point-of-use electric water heaters across the whole school estate instead of a circulatory hot water system.</li>
