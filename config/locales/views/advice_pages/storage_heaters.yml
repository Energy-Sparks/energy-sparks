            <p>Your school should only be using electricity for storage heaters during the winter. Most schools turn the heating on after the Autumn half term holiday in November, and off after Easter in April, or perhaps a little later if it's an early Easter holiday.</p>
            <p>By comparing your storage heater usage with the local weather we can highlight when your storage heaters have been on during warm and cold weather. This is shown in the following chart.</p>

          title: Seasonal control
          you_should_ensure: You should ensure that storage heaters are turned off during weekends and holidays, and shorten the period when they are used during the year.

              <p>This chart plots the outside temperature (x axis) versus the storage heater electricity consumption for all the days of the last year when the storage heaters were turned on. The trendline shows the ideal electricity consumption if the thermostatic control is working perfectly i.e. all the points sit on a straight line.</p>
              <p>If the heating has good thermostatic control (a high R<sup>2</sup> value) then the points at the top of chart when the heating is on should be close to the trend line.</p>
              <p>This is because the amount of heating required on a single day is linearly proportional to the difference between the inside and outside temperature, and any variation from the trend line would suggest thermostatic control isn't working too well.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, for storage heaters this is difficult because they consume the electricity overnight with no reference to the subsequent heating demand during the day.</p>
            subtitle_html: This chart shows an analysis of how closely electricity used by storage heaters in your school is aligned with the outside temperature between <span class='start-date'>%{start_month_year}</span> and <span class='end-date'>%{end_month_year}</span>

          title: Thermostatic control
          your_thermostatic_control_is_html: Your thermostatic control is %{r2}, which is %{r2_rating_adjective}. For storage heaters, an R<sup>2</sup> value of over 0.5 is good. A perfect value is 1.0. The lower the value below 1.0, the worse the school's thermostatic control.

      insights:
        advice_html: |-
          <p>Storage heaters work differently from other forms of heating in that they consume electricity overnight, store the energy, and then release the stored heat to classrooms during the day.</p>
          <p>In contrast most gas heating systems consume gas to produce heat immediately, so only consume energy during the school day.</p>

          <p>To the reduce the amount of energy used by storage heaters in your school:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep an eye on the weather forecast, particularly in the Spring, and try to remember to turn your heating off when it is warm outside. Energy Sparks automatically emails you if it is going to be warm in the following week - keep an eye on your weekly alert email.</li>
            <li>Normally, storage heaters should be switched off during the school holidays and at weekends. If not currently installed, adding 7-day timers will be worth the investment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Check out the Energy Sparks case studies focused on improving storage heater control:</p>
