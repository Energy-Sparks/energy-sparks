      analysis:
        baseload_high: Your baseload is high.
        baseload_high_details_html: If you matched the baseload of other schools of the same size you would save %{estimated_savings} per year.
        baseload_low: Your baseload is low.
        baseload_low_details_html: This is good, and as a result you are saving %{estimated_savings} per year versus other schools of a similar size.
        baseload_low_extra_savings_html: If you matched the baseload of the best performing schools you could save %{estimated_savings} per year.

          baseload_chart_considerations:
          - If your baseload has changed, for example suddenly increasing or decreasing, you should be able to track down and explain the cause of this change. Consider whether the school has recently purchased new equipment or equipment serviced. Check the date of the change against any record of work done in the school.
          - A sudden increase in the winter could be related to heating being left on overnight. This might be necessary during very cold periods, but it is useful to check that baseload levels return to normal once the cold spell has passed.
          - A very large decrease over the summer holidays is good, it shows that appliances and equipment have been switched off. Perhaps fridges and freezers in the kitchen were emptied or consolidated. Consider how significant that drop is - if caused by switching off fridges and freezers, they might be inefficient enough to require replacement. Think about whether your school can replicate that decrease for other holidays, or even weekends.
          baseload_chart_explanation: Each point on this chart represents the average baseload over the hours a school is closed on that day. You can click on a point in the chart and it will drill down to show you the full electricity usage on that day.
          baseload_chart_subtitle_html: This chart shows the electricity baseload for your school between <span class="start-date">%{start_month_year}</span> and <span class="end-date">%{end_month_year}</span>.

          long_term_baseload_meter_chart_title: Long term trends in your electricity baseload for a single meter
        long_term_trends:
          intro: Unless the school has physically increased in size, if you are managing your baseload electricity consumption well you would expect baseload to reduce over time as appliances and computers have become more power efficient with lower standby power requirements. If this is not the case then you should look to identify the cause of the increase.
          table_description: The table below shows the annual average baseload for all of the years we have data for your school.
          title: Long term trends
        meter_breakdown:
          intro: Your school has multiple electricity meters. The section below shows analysis of the baseload electricity use for each meter. You might be able to use this information to identify high energy consumption in certain parts of your school.

          table_description: The table below shows a breakdown of the average baseload for your school for the last %{months_analysed} months by meter.

          title: Baseload charts by meter
        multiple_meters_suggestion_html: Ideally, there should be little variation in baseload between different days and seasons. If you notice unusual changes or very high baseload, you might be able to narrow down what is causing it by looking at the %{link} of your baseload below.

          title: Recent trend
        seasonal_variation:
          intro_1: At a well-managed school the baseload should remain the same throughout the year, there should be no reason why the electricity consumption at midnight on a school day should be higher in the winter than in the summer.
          intro_2: The most common causes of high seasonal variation are electric heating or inefficient security lights being left on overnight in winter.
          table_description: The meter breakdown in the table below may help to identify where in the school, seasonal variation comes from.

        summary: This section gives a more detailed analysis of your school’s electricity baseload and some things to look out for.
        title: Baseload Analysis
        usage_last_month:
          one: Your baseload for the last month was %{baseload_usage} kW.
          other: Your baseload over the last %{count} months was %{baseload_usage} kW.
          zero: Your baseload for the last month was %{baseload_usage} kW.
        usage_other: Other schools with a similar number of pupils have a baseload of %{benchmark_usage} kW.
        usage_percent_html: Your baseload represents %{percent} of your annual consumption.
        weekday_variation:
          intro_1: At a well-managed school the baseload should remain the same throughout the week, there should be no reason why the electricity consumption at midnight on a weekday should be higher than during the weekend.
          intro_2: The most common cause of weekday variation is a high energy consuming appliance which is turned on on a Monday and off again on a Friday.
          table_description: The meter breakdown in the table below may help to identify where in the school, daily variation variation comes from.
