            footer: There will be some gas usage at weekends from appliances and devices left on, but the school should aim to minimise these. Schools with low weekend gas consumption aim to switch as many appliances off as possible on a Friday afternoon, sometimes providing the caretaker or cleaning staff with a checklist as to what they should be turning off.

        next_steps: Make sure that your heating is set to only heat the school when it needs to be warm. Heating and hot water can be switched off for evenings, weekends and holidays and heating should not come on too early in the mornings. Use a checklist of energy saving tasks to be completed before holidays.
