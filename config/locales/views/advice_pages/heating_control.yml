              It suggests a better time for your heating to have switched on based on that day's weather on that day, along with an expected saving if you changed your heating to match the recommended time.

              This is a useful graph for determining how well controlled the timing of the boiler is. A well timed boiler should only come on at about 6:00am to get the school up to temperature by 8:00am, and then turn off again about half an hour before the school closes.

              If your school has underfloor heating, it may take a few hours longer to warm up, but does not need to be on 24 hours a day.
