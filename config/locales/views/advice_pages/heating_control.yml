              This table shows the time your heating switched on for the most recent week for which we have data.

              It suggests a better time for your heating to have switched on based on that day's weather on that day, along with an expected saving if you changed your heating to match the recommended time.

          estimated_savings_html: Your school could reduce its gas usage by %{estimated_savings_kwh} kWh by turning its boiler off in warm weather. For example earlier in the Spring and later in the Autumn. This would save %{estimated_savings_gbp} and %{estimated_savings_co2} kg CO2 annually.
          heating_on_in_warm_weather_days: Last year your school heating was on for %{days} days during warm weather. This is %{adjective}.

              This is a useful graph for determining how well controlled the timing of the boiler is. A well timed boiler should only come on at about 6:00am to get the school up to temperature by 8:00am, and then turn off again about half an hour before the school closes.

              If your school has underfloor heating, it may take a few hours longer to warm up, but does not need to be on 24 hours a day.
