          table_footer: There may be reasons for some holidays to have higher energy use, for example additional security lighting in winter or contractors working on school property. Ideally the summer holiday should be lower than other holidays as more equipment and appliances can be switched off.
          table_intro: The table below shows a summary of your electricity usage during the last year of school holidays. It includes average energy use per day to enable comparison for different length holidays.

            footer: There will be some electricity usage at weekends from appliances and devices left on, but the school should aim to minimise these. Schools with low weekend electricity consumption aim to switch as many appliances off as possible on a Friday afternoon, sometimes providing the caretaker or cleaning staff with a checklist as to what they should be turning off.
