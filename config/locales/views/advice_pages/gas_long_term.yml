              percent_html: Your annual gas usage is %{percent} higher than the best performing schools.
              savings_html: If you matched the usage of those schools you could save %{estimated_savings_kwh} or %{estimated_savings_gbp} per year.

              percent_html: Your annual gas usage is %{percent} lower than the best performing schools.
              title: Your gas usage is low.
          table_explanation: The following table outlines the potential benefits of reducing your gas use to match %{school_type} schools with a similar number of pupils.
          title: Comparison with other schools
        degree_days: A number of charts have an additional blue line showing 'degrees days' which is a measure of how cold it was during the period. Degree days are the inverse of temperature. The higher the degree days the lower the temperature.
        long_term_trends:
          summary: This section looks at how your gas consumption changes during the year, and compares consumption for the last 12 months with previous years where we have data.
          title: Long term trends
        meter_breakdown:
          summary: Your school has multiple gas meters. The section below shows gas use for each meter. You might be able to use this information to identify high or unusual energy consumption in certain parts of your school.
          table_explanation: Having multiple meters can help you understand your energy use better, however, there is a significant standing charge for each meter of more than £1,000 per year, so there is potential for saving by consolidating meters.
          table_introduction: The table below covers usage between %{start_date} and %{end_date}.

        gas_by_month_year:
          explanation: This chart can be a quick way to spot whether changes to heating and hot water control are having an impact on your gas consumption. You need to be careful when comparing months with holidays, particularly Easter, which some years is in March and other times in April.

        gas_longterm_trend:
          explanation: Reducing gas consumption can be achieved by turning your school's thermostat down, reducing out of hours usage, insulating your buildings or installing a new more efficient gas boiler.
          subtitle_html: This chart, and the table below give the breakdown of gas consumption between school day open and closed, holidays and weekends for each full year of data we have for <span class='meter'>%{meter}</span>
          temp_compensation: There is no temperature compensation applied to this chart. You should expect the amount of gas used each year to vary and broadly follow degree days - the colder it is outside, the more gas should be used in the school.

            <p>
            The amount of gas used throughout the year should follow closely with degree days - the colder it is outside, the more gas should be used in the school. You should expect consumption to be quite low between the Easter holidays and autumn half term as the heating can be switched off and gas only used for the hot water, kitchen, or to heat a swimming pool. Gas consumption should be low during the holidays - shown in red.

          explanation: This chart shows how your gas consumption varies throughout the year over the long term. Each bar represents a whole week and the split between holiday, weekend and school day open and closed consumption for that week. It highlights how gas consumption generally increases in the winter and is lower in the summer. You can click on the chart to explore the data in more detail.
