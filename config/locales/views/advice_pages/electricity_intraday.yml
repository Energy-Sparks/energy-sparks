              This chart allows you to see how your school’s electricity consumption compares with other energy efficient schools throughout the school day. A 'benchmark' school represents the 30.0% best ranked primary schools and 'exemplar' the 17.5% best primary schools.
            </p>
            <p>
              This chart can be useful to observe where your school’s pattern of energy use differs from other schools. There might be anomalies like jumps in usage outside school hours which can’t be accounted for.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your school has high consumption overnight, compared to the benchmark schools, this could indicate that you need to reduce your baseload. If consumption is mainly high during the middle of the day, this indicates you need to reduce your peak electricity use.
            </p>
          comparison_chart_subtitle_html: The chart below provides a comparison of your school's average consumption during school days between <span class="start-date">%{start_month_year}</span> and <span class="end-date">%{end_month_year}</span>, and includes a comparison with 'benchmark' and 'exemplar' schools.

              This chart shows the peak electricity usage at the school (normally during the middle of the day) and the overnight electricity consumption.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is useful in diagnosing what changes have happened over the last year which may have changed electricity consumption.
