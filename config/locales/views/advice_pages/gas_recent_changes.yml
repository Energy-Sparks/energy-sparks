          compare_recent_days_chart_explanation: The chart automatically uses the most recently available days. Use the options below the chart to compare alternative days.
          compare_recent_days_chart_subtitle: This chart shows the gas consumption throughout the day on two recent days.
          compare_recent_days_chart_title: Your school's half hourly gas use for two recent days
          compare_recent_weeks_chart_explanation: The chart automatically uses the last two fully available weeks. Use the options below the chart to compare alternative weeks.
          compare_recent_weeks_chart_subtitle: A comparison of your school’s gas use across two recent weeks.
          compare_recent_weeks_chart_title: Your school's daily gas use for two recent weeks
          impact_of_temperature_chart_explanation_html: Degree days are the inverse of temperature. The higher the degree days the lower the temperature. %{more_detail_url}. If the heating boiler is working well at your school, degree days should track the gas usage quite closely.
          impact_of_temperature_chart_subtitle_html: This chart shows your schools’ gas use between <span class="start-date">%{start_date}</span> and <span class="end-date">%{end_date}</span>, including a comparison with degree days.

        expected_usage_patterns: In a school with a heating system that is working well (good boiler, good pipework for heat distribution, large enough radiators, and reasonable insulation), you might expect the heating to turn on at about 6am, and peak for the next 2 hours while the school is being heated up, and then gradually reduce during the day. In most schools the heat generated by electrical equipment and 30 pupils in a classroom would suggest classrooms need very little additional heating from the school's boiler, once the pupils arrive.

        optimal_start_control: If the boiler has 'optimal start control' configured, you might notice the start time of the boiler changing automatically ‐ from perhaps 6:30am in milder weather to earlier e.g. 4:30pm in colder weather. In very cold weather you might notice the heating coming on 'at random' - this is most likely frost protection - the boiler turning the heating system on to stop the school's pipework freezing.

        summary: This section gives a more detailed analysis of how your school’s gas consumption has changed recently. It can be particularly useful if trying to investigate a change in gas consumption or monitoring the impact of action taken in the school.
