      your_electricity_tariffs_html: Your electricity tariffs have changed in the last year, the last change was on %{last_change_date}, before this date the average tariff was %{rate_before_gbp_per_kwh}/kWh, and since it is %{rate_after_gbp_per_kwh}/kWh. This will increase your electricity costs by %{percent_change} going forwards. Cost calculations used for most charts and analysis do not include standing charges except for the more accurate bill validation information presented on the Cost analysis page.

      tooltips:
        bill_components:
          00_30_to_07_00: This is the charge for electricity consumed between 00:30 and 00:70 per kWh
          07_30_to_00_00: This is the charge for electricity consumed between 07:30 and 00:30 per kWh
          agreed_availability_charge: A charge for the cabling to provide an agreed maximum amount of power in KVA of electricity to the school. This can often be reduced via discussions with your energy supplier
          all_day: all day
          climate_change_levy__2021_22: 'Climate Change Levy: based on your carbon emissions (per kWh of consumption). If you reduce your consumption your CCL will reduce'
          commodity_rate: The charge per kWh of consumption for the whole day
          data_collection_dcda_agent_charge: The cost of collecting your half hourly meter readings twice a day. Energy Sparks uses this half hourly data to analyse your energy consumption
          duos: 'Distributed use of system charge: - charge per kWh of usage during these times: %{charge_times}. To reduce, reduce the schools usage during these times'
          excess_availability_charge: A 'fine' for going over your 'Agreed Availability Limit' in a month. If you are being 'fined' for more than a few months a year its generally cheaper to ask your energy supplier to increase your 'Agreed Availability Limit'
          feed_in_tariff_levy: A fee to cover the costs of supporting renewables on the electricity network. You can reduce this by reducing your energy consumption
          fixed_charge: Fixed fee for your energy supply
          flat_rate: The charge per kWh of consumption for the whole day
          meter_asset_provider_charge: The cost of a third party maintaining your meter
          nhh_automatic_meter_reading_charge: The cost of collecting your half hourly meter readings twice a day. Energy Sparks uses this half hourly data to analyse your energy consumption
          nhh_metering_agent_charge: The cost of collecting your half hourly meter readings twice a day. Energy Sparks uses this half hourly data to analyse your energy consumption
          non_commodity_rate: All non-rate charges proportion to kWh consumption (for some contracts these include network charges)
          reactive_power_charge: A charge based on how out of balance the voltage and current consumption of your school is. If it is a large cost then its possible to rebalance your school but your will need an electrician to help you. Energy Sparks can't calculate this because we currently don't have access to the raw data to calculate this, so you will need to look at your paper bills; the cost for most schools is less than Â£20 per month
          renewable_energy_obligation: Renewable Energy Obligation - at a fixed government rate per kWh consumed
          settlement_agency_fee: A fee to pay for the cost of maintaining and reading your meter
          site_fee: Miscellaneous fixed fee
          standing_charge: Fixed fee for your energy supply
          tnuos: 'Transmission Network Use Of System Charge: based on the schools peak consumption on winter weekdays between 17:00 and 19:30 - to reduce make sure as many appliances as possible are turned off during the winter when the school closes for the day'
