        <p>Consider the following things when observing this chart:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If your baseload has changed, for example suddenly increasing or decreasing, you should be able to track down and explain the cause of this change. Consider whether the school has recently purchased new equipment. A very large decrease over the summer holidays is good, it shows that appliances and equipment have been switched off. Perhaps fridges and freezers in the kitchen were emptied or consolidated. Consider how significant that drop is - if caused by switching off fridges and freezers, they might be inefficient enough to require replacement. Think about whether your school can replicate that decrease for other holidays, or even weekends.</li>
        </ul>
      analysis_baseload_high: Your baseload is high.
      analysis_baseload_high_details_html: If you matched the baseload of other schools of the same size you would save %{estimated_savings}.
      analysis_baseload_low: Your baseload is low.
      analysis_baseload_low_details_html: Your school's baseload is low, which is good and as a result you are saving %{estimated_savings} per year versus the average of other schools of a similar size.
      analysis_electricity_baseload_chart_explanation: Each point on this chart represents the average over the hours a school is closed on that day. You can click on a point in the chart and it will drill down to show you the usage on that day. Ideally, there should be little variation between different days and seasons.
      analysis_electricity_baseload_chart_subtitle: This chart shows the electricity baseload for your school between %{start_month_year} and %{end_month_year}.
      analysis_electricity_baseload_chart_title: Electricity baseload for the last 12 months
      analysis_electricity_long_term_baseload_chart_title: Long term baseload comparison with benchmark and exemplar schools
      analysis_electricity_long_term_baseload_chart_subtitle: This chart shows the long term trend in your school’s baseload between %{start_month_year} and %{end_month_year}, and includes a comparison with 'benchmark' and 'exemplar' schools
      analysis_electricity_long_term_baseload_chart_explanation: You can click on the chart to drill down to individual days and work out at what times of day and year your school is doing either better or worse than these schools.
      analysis_long_term_trends_intro: Unless the school has physically increased in size, if you are managing your baseload electricity consumption well you would expect baseload to reduce over time as appliances and computers have become more power efficient with lower standby power requirements. If this is not the case then you should look to identify the cause of the increase.
      analysis_long_term_trends_table_description: The table below shows the annual average baseload for all of the years we have data for your school.

      analysis_usage: Your electricity baseload over the last 12 months was %{baseload_usage} kW. Other schools with a similar number of pupils have a baseload of %{benchmark_usage} kW.
