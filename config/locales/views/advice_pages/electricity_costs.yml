              <p>
                We suggest you contact your energy manager or energy supplier to discuss reducing the
                limit to save your costs. The main risk of doing this is if your annual usage goes up
                if you are planning on signficantly increasing the size of the school or electricity
                consumption in the near future?

          <p>Your electricity bill is broken down into a variety of different charges. Some of these are fixed standing charges, while others vary depending on how much electricity you use and when you use it.
          </p>
          <p>
          Understanding these charges can help you reduce your costs and may help with bill validation.
