              <p>Your current maximum annual capacity usage of %{kw} kW is significantly lower than your agreed limit of %{agreed_limit_kw} kW for meter %{mpan_mprn}.</p>

              <p>
                We suggest you contact your energy manager or energy supplier to discuss reducing the
                limit to save your costs. The main risk of doing this is if your annual usage goes up
                if you are planning on signficantly increasing the size of the school or electricity
                consumption in the near future?
