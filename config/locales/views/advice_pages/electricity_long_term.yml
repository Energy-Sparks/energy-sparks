          assessment:
            high:
              percent_html: Your annual electricity usage is %{percent} higher than the best performing schools.
              savings_html: If you matched the usage of those schools you could save %{estimated_savings_kwh} or %{estimated_savings_gbp} per year.
              title: Your electricity usage is high.
            low:
              percent_html: Your annual electricity usage is %{percent} lower than the best performing schools.
              title: Your electricity usage is low.
          table_explanation: The following table outlines the potential benefits of reducing your electricity use to match %{school_type} schools with a similar number of pupils.

        long_term_trends:
          summary: This section looks at how your electricity consumption changes during the year, and compares consumption for the last 12 months with previous years where we have data.
          title: Long term trends
        meter_breakdown:
          summary: Your school has multiple electricity meters. The section below shows electricity use for each meter. You might be able to use this information to identify high or unusual energy consumption in certain parts of your school.
          table_explanation: Having multiple meters can help you understand your energy use better, however, there is a significant standing charge for each meter of more than £1,000 per year, so there is potential for saving by consolidating meters.
          table_introduction: The table below covers usage between %{start_date} and %{end_date}.

        electricity_by_month_year:
          explanation: This chart can be a quick way to spot whether energy saving behaviour and lighting and equipment updates are having an impact on your electricity consumption. You need to be careful when comparing months with holidays, particularly Easter, which some years is in March and other times in April.

          title_two_years: Monthly electricity consumption comparison over the last few academic years
        electricity_longterm_trend:
          explanation: Unless the school has had additional buildings added, if you are managing your electricity consumption well this should show a downward trend; more modern ICT equipment, LED lighting and behaviour change all contribute to reducing electricity usage.
          subtitle_html: This chart gives the breakdown of electricity consumption between school day open and closed, holidays and weekends for each full year of data we have for <span class='meter'>%{meter}</span>

            This chart shows how your electricity consumption varies throughout the year. Each bar represents a whole week and the split between holiday, weekend and school day open and closed consumption for that week. It highlights how electricity consumption generally increases in the winter and is lower in the summer. You can click on the chart to explore the data in more detail.
            </p>
            <p>
            The colouring on the graph also highlights electricity usage over holidays in red. Holiday usage is normally caused by appliances and computers being left on (called 'baseload'). The school should aim to reduce this baseload (which also occurs at weekends and overnight during school days) as this will have a big impact on a school's energy costs. Sometimes this can be achieved by switching appliances off on Fridays before weekends and holidays, and sometimes by replacing older electrical appliances with more efficient new ones.

        group_by_week_electricity_unlimited:
          explanation: This chart shows how your electricity consumption varies throughout the year over the long term. Each bar represents a whole week and the split between holiday, weekend and school day open and closed consumption for that week. It highlights how electricity consumption generally increases in the winter and is lower in the summer. You can click on the chart to explore the data in more detail.
