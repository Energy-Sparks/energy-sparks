      <h1 class="pt-3">Energy Sparks Terms and Conditions for participating schools and users</h1>
      <p>Revision date&#58; 3rd October 2023</p>
      <h2> 1. We are Energy Sparks, a registered charity in England and Wales, registration 1189273. </h2>
      <h2> 2. You are a participating school or similar educational organisation or an Energy Sparks site user. </h2>
      <h2> 3. Energy Sparks service provision to schools </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> 3.1 Energy Sparks will provide participating school(s) with access to the Energy Sparks online tool, where schools’ energy usage (gas and electricity) and solar generation and export data (when available), will be graphically presented and analysed for both school staff and pupils to readily access, providing energy saving recommendations and associated learning, energy monitoring and energy saving pupil activities and resources. </li>
        <li> 3.2 Energy Sparks will provide participating schools with automated online, email and text alerts and regular newsletters for signed up users. </li>
        <li> 3.3 School staff and supporting volunteers will have access to Energy Sparks training webinars. </li>
        <li> 3.4 Energy Sparks will provide email support to participating school users for any technical problems, user queries or specific energy advice questions. Initial email response times will be within 3 working days, Monday to Friday during state school term times. Terms are defined as average state school term dates in England and Wales. Energy Sparks will aim to resolve most user queries within 5 working days during state school term times. More technical queries or problems, particularly those problems involving meter errors or data feeds may require further investigation before a full response can be provided. Energy Sparks offers a limited support service during state school holidays due to reduced demand. The school holiday service is designed to keep the Energy Sparks online tool running, but Energy Sparks will not normally respond to individual user or school queries or advice requests until the start of the next school term, or within 20 working days whichever is the shorter. Energy Sparks does not offer a permanently manned support telephone number, but users can request a call back at a mutually convenient time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2> 4. Obligations for participating schools </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          4.1 The school head teacher, business manager or bursar will provide consent that the following information will be requested from the school’s smart meters, energy supplier or meter operator on a daily or more frequent basis.
          <ul>
            <li> 4.1.1 Half hourly energy consumption, generation and export information for both gas and electricity. Both historical and ongoing data will be obtained where available. </li>
            <li> 4.1.2 Energy tariff information containing information of the price you are charged for energy consumed to provide more accurate cost and savings estimates through the Energy Sparks tool </li>
            <li> 4.1.3 Information identifying the energy meter (number, location, type) </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li> 4.2 Participating schools will nominate an Energy Sparks champion. This is a lead adult who will act as the Energy Sparks account administrator for their school, support pupil energy saving activities, receive Energy Sparks alerts and newsletters and check their school's Energy Sparks online account regularly to see their school's energy use, and what actions they need to do next. </li>
        <li> 4.3 Participating schools will commit to engage with Energy Sparks through a pupil eco-team or similar, using pupil-led action to drive energy reduction measures at the school. </li>
        <li> 4.4 Funded schools receiving free access will nominate at least three Energy Sparks champions. These will include a member of the senior leadership team, a business/facilities/estates/site manager and a teacher. When staff leave the school they will commit to hand over their Energy Sparks user role to another suitable staff member. Staff users are strongly encouraged to attend at least one Energy Sparks training webinar per school year.</li>
        <li> 4.5 Funded schools will commit to complete and record at least one <a href=%{programme_types_url}>Energy Sparks programme</a> of pupil activities per school year (between 5 and 10 activities per programme); carry out and record at least <a href="%{intervention_type_groups_url}">one adult action</a> per long school term based on Energy Sparks’ recommendations for the school; and nominate at least one named staff member to carry out a holiday switch off before each holiday.</li>
        <li> 4.6 Energy Sparks will support all schools to engage and increase their energy saving activity, but if there is no or limited evidence of engagement with the Energy Sparks tool and resources, funded places may be withdrawn.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>5. Fees</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> 5.1 Funding from central government, local authorities and charitable trusts and foundations currently allows Energy Sparks to provide its services free of charge to around 1000 schools across the UK. Energy Sparks is seeking new funders to allow us to maintain and extend our free offer to more state schools.<br /><br />We may also support state schools as a paid for service. Access to the online tool, education resources, training webinars and email and phone support costs £475 per year per school for state schools joining us from a Multi-Academy Trust or Local Authority cluster or £525 per year for individual schools. We will confirm any costs in writing before we proceed with your school’s account set up.</li>
        <li> 5.2 A participating school’s energy supplier or meter operator may charge the school a supplementary fee for supplying half hourly data which will be added to the school’s energy bill. The school’s energy contract manager or supplier will be able to provide further information. </li>
        <li> 5.3 UK Independent schools are required to pay an annual fee to access Energy Sparks. The fee varies according to site complexity and numbers of meters. Contact us on hello@energysparks.uk for a quote. </li>

      <h2>7. Energy and associated data collection, processing and management</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>7.1 Energy Sparks will collect half hourly energy consumption, generation and export information for both gas and electricity from the school’s smart meters, energy supplier or meter operator on a daily or more frequent basis. Both historical and ongoing data will be obtained where available.</li>
        <li>7.2 Energy Sparks will collect energy tariff information containing information of the price the school is charged for energy consumed to provide more accurate cost and savings estimates through the Energy Sparks tool. To protect commercial confidentiality, accurate tariff information is only presented to users who have logged into a school’s Energy Sparks account. Publicly accessible cost estimates are calculated using average cost data.</li>
        <li>7.3 Energy Sparks will collect the school’s meter number and location from the school’s Local Authority, Multi-Academy Trust or energy supplier where available.</li>
        <li>7.4 Energy Sparks will use this consumption, generation and export data collected to support the Energy Sparks online energy management tool to enable users to see the school’s energy consumption, solar generation and export, and receive energy saving alerts and recommendations.</li>
        <li>7.5 Energy Sparks will collect and use consumption, generation and export data for as long as the school’s energy data remains displayed on the Energy Sparks website&#58; www.energysparks.uk.</li>
        <li>7.6 Energy Sparks publishes most energy data to its website under an open licence which will allow it to be accessed, used and shared by anyone. Independent schools can opt-in to a private version of the Energy Sparks tool which means their energy data is only visible to logged in users. This service is available at extra cost. Contact us on hello@energysparks.uk for further information.</li>
        <li>7.7 Participating schools have the right to withdraw consent to their data being published to Energy Sparks at any time. You can withdraw consent by emailing hello@energysparks.uk. Energy Sparks will then remove the school’s ongoing and historical energy data from the Energy Sparks website within one month.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>8. Third party service providers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>8.1 If the school has an AMR meter providing half hourly energy consumption data, Energy Sparks may collect the energy data from the school’s supplier, meter operator or Local Authority. Further details about the way we obtain individual school’s data are available on request tby contacting us at hello@energysparks.uk.</li>
        <li>8.2 If a school has solar panels Energy Sparks may obtain solar generation, export and grid consumption data from the school’s solar monitoring system. If this is not possible we will obtain modelled solar generation data from Solar PV Live, a service provided by the University of Sheffield.</li>
        <li>
          8.3 If the school has a SMETS2 or SMETS1+ smart meter installed Energy Sparks uses n3rgy Ltd to collect energy data via the Data Communications Company (DCC). In this case, n3rgy Ltd provides full visibility and control of the information shared with Energy Sparks via a consumer portal (https://data.n3rgy.com/consumer) where authorised users can&#58;
          <ul>
            <li>8.3.1 Review which organisations you have granted data access to.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>8.4 All consumption, generation and tariff information gathered by n3rgy Ltd will also be anonymised and pooled within a data set which is made available to all organisations who use the n3rgy service. This enables n3rgy and its customers to better understand the way that we use, generate and pay for energy, with the intent to further improve our nation’s energy efficiency and carbon reduction. Due to the nature of anonymisation used, it is not possible to identify your data from this wider set, and therefore to remove your contribution.</li>
