    intro: Energy Sparks provides an online energy analysis tool and energy education programme specifically designed to help schools reduce their electricity and gas usage through the analysis of smart meter data. Energy Sparks can help Local Authorities meet their climate emergency commitments, democratise access to schools’ energy data and empower school staff and students with taking no and low cost action to reduce their school’s carbon footprint.

      text_html: The comparison function is amazing…; The data in the comparison tab will be very useful for analysing and reporting purposes, and it offers a wide variety of benchmarks. I think this is a 'fab' idea and very useful tool.

      text_html: I initially got involved with Energy Sparks as I thought it would inspire the children to be more eco-aware. Little did I realise back then how much we would be saving now! …We should be able to save £800 annually so that's over £15 extra per child per year - all thanks to Energy Sparks.

      <h4><strong>Comparing school energy performance</strong></h4>
      <p>
        Energy Sparks provides a <a href="/benchmarks">school comparison and benchmarking tool</a> to allow portfolio analysis of schools in Local Authority groups or across the whole Energy Sparks portfolio. This tool compares performance against a range of benchmarks including per pupil and per floor area, school holiday consumption and heating start time, and is a powerful means of identifying the worst performing schools to target with additional support and the best performing schools to feature in case studies.

      <h4><strong>How does Energy Sparks access the schools’ energy data?</strong></h4>
      <p>Energy Sparks normally obtains energy data direct from the energy supplier or meter data collector (DC/DA)</p>
      <p>
        Where schools purchase energy through a Local Authority contract,  Energy Sparks will normally need a Letter of Authority and a list of the relevant meter numbers provided by the Council energy team. Sometimes, the Local Authority can set up automated data reports to Energy Sparks through their own supplier portal access. Where schools have alternative purchasing arrangements, they will normally provide their own Letter of Authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each individual school will also provide permission for us to access and publish their energy data as part of their account set up, alongside confirming agreement with our <a href="/terms_and_conditions">Terms and Conditions</a>.
      </p>

      <h4><strong>What does it cost for Local Authorities?</strong></h4>
      <p>
        Funding from charitable trusts and foundations, community energy companies and corporate partners currently allows Energy Sparks to provide its services free of charge to a limited number of schools in certain regions of the UK. Energy Sparks is seeking new funders to allow us to maintain and extend our free offer to more state schools.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also support new Local Authorities as a paid for service. Access to the online energy management tool, education resources, training webinars, email support and a Local Authority dashboard costs £475 per school per year for state schools within a Local Authority cluster group.

      <h4><strong>What additional support is needed from the Local Authority?</strong></h4>
      <p>
        In addition to supporting access to the school’s energy data, Local Authority officers will be expected to support Energy Sparks with school recruitment using marketing materials provided by Energy Sparks. Energy Sparks is most impactful when it is linked with other sustainability focused activities ongoing across your Local Authority. Energy Sparks can often present to business manager or school leadership forums, school climate change forums or other appropriate events to promote recruitment and ongoing engagement and impact.
