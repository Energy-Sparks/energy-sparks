        "Energy Sparks has enabled children at Freshford to investigate how energy is used in different parts of the school and devise strategies to reduce the school's consumption. The children's enthusiasm was kick-started by the competitive element and they’ve worked effectively with staff and the local community to think innovatively about what we can do to reduce our impact on the environment and reduce costs. The children developed and presented evidence-based initiatives to the school's business managers, securing installation of energy-efficient lighting and kitchen equipment, movement-sensor-switches, and a solar-panel campaign.
        <br><br>
        The Energy Sparks  resources are inspirational, powerful and transformational tools for all schools that will enable them to reduce their CO2 footprint, save money and help children to develop a powerful can-do attitude towards the challenges of global warming."

      <h4><strong>Energy Sparks shows schools when and how much energy they are using and provides tailored energy saving advice designed for individual schools</strong></h4>
      <p>
        Using a school’s electricity, gas and solar data, Energy Sparks shows pupils, staff and the wider school community how much energy the school is using. The online tool presents bespoke analysis of the energy data with suggestions of actions the school community could take to save energy and reduce the school’s carbon emissions.
      </p>

      <h4><strong>How much energy can participating schools save?</strong></h4>
      <p>
        Most schools participating with Energy Sparks can expect to achieve energy savings of around 10% in their first year of engagement with Energy Sparks, resulting in cost savings of around £2500-£6000 (depending on tariffs) and 8 tonnes of CO2 based on an average 2 form entry primary school. Energy Sparks' best performing schools have achieved savings of up to 30%, generally by reducing school holiday, weekend and overnight heating use and cutting their electricity baseload. Examples of savings achieved at participating schools are provided in the Energy Sparks' <a href="/case-studies">Case Studies</a>.

      <h4><strong>What meters does the school need to join Energy Sparks?</strong></h4>
      <p>
        To join Energy Sparks you need smart meters installed which are capable of providing half hourly electricity and gas consumption data to Energy Sparks. These can be Half-Hourly (HH), Automated Meter Reading (AMR) or Smart Metering Equipment Technical Specifications (SMETS2) meters. If you don’t have the right meters installed, you can request an upgrade from your energy supplier. Energy Sparks recommends SMETS2 for electricity and AMR for gas where available.

        <p><strong>State schools (maintained and academies)</strong></p>
        <p>
        Funding from charitable trusts and foundations, community energy companies and corporate partners currently allows Energy Sparks to provide its services free of charge to a limited number of schools in certain regions of the UK. Energy Sparks is seeking new funders to allow us to maintain and extend our free offer to more state schools.
        </p>
        <p>
        We also support state schools as a paid for service. Access to the online tool, education resources, training webinars and email and phone support costs £475 per year per school for state schools joining us from a Multi-Academy Trust or Local Authority cluster or £525 per year for individual schools. Complete our enrolment form to register your interest in joining Energy Sparks.

        This basic package covers support for up to 10 meters per year. Additional meters are charged at £10 per meter per year.
        </p>
        <p>
        The basic package provides a publicly visible dashboard in line with all state schools.
