          These energy audits involve energy consumption data analysis, a site visit and use of a thermal imaging camera during the winter months, a report and action plan.  Accurate quotes will be provided based upon the school’s site, requirements and location. Below are indicative costs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Primary school: £910</li>
          <li>Single site secondary school: £1,400</li>
          <li>Multi-site secondary or independent school: £2,050</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ideally we like to involve the students in our audits, providing opportunities for students to shadow our auditor during the day, use the thermal imaging camera and we normally include an initial feedback session to the eco-team and staff at the end of the visit.

        <p>
          Virtual energy audits take place without a physical visit to the school and are based on the energy auditor's assessment of your school's energy consumption data as presented on Energy Sparks. The audit consists of a one hour online meeting with school representatives, typically the estate manager or caretaker, business manager, eco-team lead and one or two student representatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the online meeting, we would expect you to provide information on your school, its fabric, heating, hot water systems, ICT and lighting to help with the audit process. Our auditor then takes you through any issues highlighted through the Energy Sparks analysis and provides advice on how best to reduce consumption.

          The main focus, initially, is on quick low-cost wins, such as looking at changing boiler timings. The session can also review strategic capital investments, for example, looking at the benefits of upgrading to LED lighting.

          After the meeting, our auditor will issue written ‘action items’ for each party to execute, this might include activities the pupils can do to help. Subsequent meetings or milestones are agreed, which includes further analysis, feedback from changes made, and potential support in terms of getting help with contractors and quotes.
