        Desktop energy reviews take place without a physical visit to the school and are based on the energy auditor's assessment of your school's energy consumption data, as presented on Energy Sparks.
        <br><br>
        The review consists of a one-hour online meeting with school representatives (typically the estate manager or caretaker, business manager, eco-team lead and one or two student representatives). The main focus is on quick, low-cost wins like changing boiler timings. The session can also review strategic capital investments, such as looking at the benefits of upgrading to LED lighting.

        Following a detailed analysis of your energy consumption data and a visit to your site, we will provide you with an in-depth report and action plan. The site visit will include the use of a thermal imaging camera and other monitoring equipment to identify issues such as heat loss from doors and windows, and problems with insulation.
        <br><br>
        We welcome pupils to participate in our audits by shadowing our auditor and using our thermal imaging camera. We normally provide an initial feedback session to the eco-team and staff at the end of our visit, giving pupils the chance to ask questions and lead on next steps.
