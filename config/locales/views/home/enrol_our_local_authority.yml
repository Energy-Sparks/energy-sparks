      <h4><strong>How do I enrol our Local Authority?</strong></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Please complete our <a href="https://forms.gle/5GhNEhBxsqNSE2Et8">enrol form</a> to share details about your schoolsâ€™ energy supply arrangements and meters. This information is necessary to allow us to assess how easily we can onboard your schools to Energy Sparks.</li>
        <li>We will contact you to discuss next steps. This can include a demo of Energy Sparks to Local Authority staff.</li>
        <li>We normally issue a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to outline expectations on both sides. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jctpizWM5GywGTMj3yHgElom19bYAsgk/view" target="_blank">View an example SLA</a>.</li>
        <li>Where schools purchase energy through a Local Authority contract,  Energy Sparks will normally need a Letter of Authority and a list of the relevant meter numbers provided by the Council energy team. Sometimes, the Local Authority can set up automated data reports to Energy Sparks through your own supplier portal access. Where schools have alternative purchasing arrangements, they will normally provide their own Letter of Authority.</li>
        <li>Each individual school will also provide permission for us to access and publish their energy data as part of their account set up, alongside confirming agreement with our <a href="/terms_and_conditions">terms and conditions</a>.</li>
        <li>Local Authority officers are expected to support Energy Sparks with school recruitment using marketing materials provided by Energy Sparks. Energy Sparks is most impactful when it is linked with other sustainability focused activities ongoing across your Local Authority. Energy Sparks can often present to business manager or school leadership forums, school climate change forums or other appropriate events to promote recruitment and ongoing engagement and impact.</li>
