      <h4><strong>How do I enrol our school?</strong></h4>
      <p>Please complete the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The Head teacher, School Business manager, Bursar or another member of your Senior Leadership team must complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/9seTjC4HaaGJCL3CA">enrolment form</a>. You will be asked to provide information on your school's electricity and gas suppliers and energy purchasing arrangements. You should nominate a member of staff who will lead on Energy Sparks engagement at your school. You will need to provide their email address so we can issue them with a link to set up your school's Energy Sparks account. Please make sure they know they are being nominated for this role.</li>
        <li>If your school is not within one of our existing areas or groups, we will send you a Letter of Authority to be completed giving us permission to request your energy data from your suppliers.</li>
        <li>If you already have half hourly metering installed (HH, AMR or SMETS2), Energy Sparks should normally be able to obtain your energy data within 2 weeks. You can find out more about our metering requirements in <a href="https://blog.energysparks.uk/a-guide-to-metering-and-how-to-find-out-what-type-of-meter-you-have-installed-at-your-school/">our guide to metering and how to find out what type of meter you have installed at your school</a>. If you donâ€™t have half hourly metering for any utilities, please contact your energy supplier to request a meter upgrade to AMR or SMETS2.</li>
        <li>We will issue an account set up link to your Energy Sparks lead. They will be asked to provide some additional information about your school and will have the opportunity to add further staff and pupils. Once this has been completed, Energy Sparks will then activate the school's data feeds and you should be able to use our full service within a few days.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4><strong>What do I need to do to make my school's involvement in Energy Sparks a success?</strong></h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Nominate an Energy Sparks champion for your school. This is a lead adult who will act as the Energy Sparks account administrator for your school, support pupil energy saving activities, receive Energy Sparks alerts telling you about changes in energy use and recommended energy saving actions, and commit to checking your school's Energy Sparks online account regularly.</li>
        <li>Add at least three staff users to your Energy Sparks account, including your estates/site manager, your sustainability lead, and a member of your senior leadership team. Nominate at least one named staff member to carry out a holiday switch off before each holiday.</li>
        <li>Set up an Energy Sparks pupil club or eco-team to meet several times a term, ideally once a fortnight. Your pupils should aim to complete at least one <a href="https://energysparks.uk/programme_types">Energy Sparks activity programme</a> each school year.</li>
        <li>Consider getting parents and community volunteers involved. Some schools use parents or other volunteers to run their Energy Sparks or eco team.</li>
        <li>Regularly check your school's energy data on Energy Sparks so that pupils, staff and volunteers can see how much difference they are making to your school's energy use, and what they need to do next.</li>
        <li>Involve the whole school. Whether through a notice board, regular assemblies or inter-class competitions, make sure the rest of the school knows why you are saving energy and what they can do to help.</li>
      </ol>
