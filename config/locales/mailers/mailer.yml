        <p>At the moment Energy Sparks is basing its analysis on school opening times of %{opening_time} to %{closing_time}. These should be the times when the pupils are arriving and leaving the school. This should be when the school is fully operational with the majority of pupils in school. Before and after school clubs can be included if the majority of the school is in use by pupils. External lettings or times when you have only a small proportion of your school estate in use by pupils should be listed under community use times.</p>
        <p>Many schools will have cleaning or other premises staff in the school outside of the times when they are open to pupils. Do not include these periods in your main school opening hours as we recommend that you should keep energy use to a minimum during these times.</p>
