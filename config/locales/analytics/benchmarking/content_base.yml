                  the electricity consumption for schools with solar PV is the total

                  consumed from the solar PV (self-consumption)

                  self-consumption is estimated where we don't have metered solar PV,

              The &apos;adjusted&apos; columns are adjusted for difference in
              temperature between the two years. So for example, if the previous year was colder
              than last year, then the adjusted previous year gas consumption
              in kWh is adjusted to last year&apos;s temperatures and would be smaller than
              the unadjusted previous year value. The adjusted percent change is a better
              indicator of the work a school might have done to reduce its energy consumption as
              it&apos;s not dependent on temperature differences between the two years.

            <p>
              Where we don't have metered data we used localised estimates;
              the percentage change should be reasonably accurate
              but kWh values may be less accurate as we currently assume
              that the school's panels face south and are inclined at 30 degrees.
              If your school&apos;s panels have a different set up, the kWh values will vary from our estimates.

              The CO2 savings achieved by generating electricity from your solar panels
              are calculated using the carbon intensity of the national electricity grid.
              As the grid decarbonises the CO2 offset by the school's solar panels will
              gradually reduce i.e. the CO2 benefit will diminish.

              The storage heater consumption is a reasonably accurate estimate

              storage heaters are typically not separately metered.
            </p>
            <p>
              For some schools the cost values may be overestimated because
              we don't have information on whether your school&apos;s storage heaters
              use a lower differential or economy 7 tariff.
