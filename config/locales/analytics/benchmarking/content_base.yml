          caveat_text_html: |-
            <p>
              However, these calculations are experimental and might not provide
              good indicators of how well the optimum start is working for all schools.
              Drilling down to look at the data for an individual school should provide
              a better indication.
            <p>
          introduction_text_html: |-
            <p>
              This experimental analysis attempts to help determine whether
              a school&apos;s optimum start control is working by looking at
              the times the boiler has started over the last year.
            </p>
          table_introduction_text_html: |-
            <p>
              The &apos;standard deviation&apos; column shows over how many hours
              the starting time has varied over the last year. If this is more than
              an hour or so, it might indicate the optimum start control is working,
              or it could be that someone has made lots of adjustments to the boiler
              start time during the year.
            </p>
            <p>
              The &apos;Regression model optimum start R2&apos; indicates how well
              correlated with outside temperature the start time of the boiler was.
              The closer to 1.0, the more correlated it was and therefore the
              more likely the optimum start control is working well.
            </p>
