              This experimental analysis attempts to help determine whether
              a school&apos;s optimum start control is working by looking at
              the times the boiler has started over the last year.

              The &apos;standard deviation&apos; column shows over how many hours
              the starting time has varied over the last year. If this is more than
              an hour or so, it might indicate the optimum start control is working,
              or it could be that someone has made lots of adjustments to the boiler
              start time during the year.
            </p>
            <p>
              The &apos;Regression model optimum start R2&apos; indicates how well
              correlated with outside temperature the start time of the boiler was.
              The closer to 1.0, the more correlated it was and therefore the
              more likely the optimum start control is working well.

              This benchmark shows the benefit of installing solar PV panels at schools which don't already
              have solar PV panels fitted. This analysis uses half hourly electricity consumption data for each
              school over the last year combined with local half hourly solar generation data to work out the
              benefit of installing solar panels. The payback and savings are calculated using the school's most
              recent tariff. Further detail is provided if you drill down to a school's individual analysis - where a
              range of different scenarios for different numbers of panels is presented.

            <p>
              This benchmark provides a measure of the schools’ thermostatic control, and the savings potential if thermostatic control is improved.
            </p>
            <p>
              Energy Sparks calculates the quality of a school's thermostatic control using a measure called 'R2'. The heating consumption of a school should be linearly proportional to the outside temperature, the colder it is the more energy is required to keep the school warm. The 'R2' is a measure of how well correlated this heating consumption is with outside temperature - the closer to 1.0 the better the control. Any value above 0.8 is good. If a school has a value below 0.5 it suggests the thermostatic control is very poor and there is a limited relationship between the temperature and the heating used to keep the school warm.

            <p>
              If there is a big variation, find out what is causing the baseload to be higher on certain days of the week, and switch off the equipment or lights causing the difference.
