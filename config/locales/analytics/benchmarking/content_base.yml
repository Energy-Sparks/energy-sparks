            <p>Schools with negative savings potential  have heating consumption below that of the best schools, which is good.

            <p>
              A school's baseload is the electricity consumed by appliances kept running at all times.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is one of the most useful benchmarks for understanding a school's electricity use, as 50% of most schools' electricity is consumed out of hours. Reducing the baseload will have a big impact on overall electricity consumption.
            </p>
            <p>
              All schools should aim to reduce their electricity baseload per pupil to that of the best schools. Schools perform roughly the same function so should be able to achieve similar electricity consumption, particularly out of hours.

            <p>
              Where we don't have metered data we used localised estimates;
              the percentage change should be reasonably accurate
              but kWh values may be less accurate as we currently assume
              that the school's panels face south and are inclined at 30 degrees.
              If your school&apos;s panels have a different set up, the kWh values will vary from our estimates.

            <p>
              The CO2 savings achieved by generating electricity from your solar panels
              are calculated using the carbon intensity of the national electricity grid.
              As the grid decarbonises the CO2 offset by the school's solar panels will
              gradually reduce i.e. the CO2 benefit will diminish.

              The storage heater consumption is a reasonably accurate estimate

            </p>
            <p>
              For some schools the cost values may be overestimated because
              we don't have information on whether your school&apos;s storage heaters
              use a lower differential or economy 7 tariff.

              temperature between the two years. So for example, if the previous year was colder
              than last year, then the adjusted previous year gas consumption
              in kWh is adjusted to last year&apos;s temperatures and would be smaller than
              the unadjusted previous year value. The adjusted percent change is a better
              indicator of the work a school might have done to reduce its energy consumption as
              it&apos;s not dependent on temperature differences between the two years.

            <p>This benchmark shows what time the boilers have been starting on average in the last week and last year.</p>
            <p>Many schools have their heating coming on too early in the morning. Generally, heating boilers shouldn’t be turning on before 5am in cold weather and 7am in milder weather. If your school heating comes on before this, you should be able to make changes to the heating controls to save energy and lots of money.</p>

            <p>This benchmark shows how much of the school’s heating is used in warm weather. Schools should aim to keep their heating off as much as possible in warm weather.

              CO2 values for electricity (including where the CO2 is
              aggregated across electricity, gas, storage heaters) is difficult
              to compare for short periods as it is dependent on the carbon intensity
              of the national grid on the days being compared and this could vary by up to
              300&percnt; from day to day.

            <p>In general, the baseload in the winter should be very similar to the summer. In practice many schools leave electric heaters on overnight when the school is unoccupied. Identifying and turning off or better timing such equipment is a quick way of saving electricity and costs.</p>

              This benchmark shows the benefit of installing solar PV panels at schools which don't already
              have solar PV panels fitted. This analysis uses half hourly electricity consumption data for each
              school over the last year combined with local half hourly solar generation data to work out the
              benefit of installing solar panels. The payback and savings are calculated using the school's most
              recent tariff. Further detail is provided if you drill down to a school's individual analysis - where a
              range of different scenarios for different numbers of panels is presented.

          introduction_text_html: |-
            <p>
              This benchmark provides a measure of the schools’ thermostatic control, and the savings potential if thermostatic control is improved.
            </p>
            <p>
              Energy Sparks calculates the quality of a school's thermostatic control using a measure called 'R2'. The heating consumption of a school should be linearly proportional to the outside temperature, the colder it is the more energy is required to keep the school warm. The 'R2' is a measure of how well correlated this heating consumption is with outside temperature - the closer to 1.0 the better the control. Any value above 0.8 is good. If a school has a value below 0.5 it suggests the thermostatic control is very poor and there is a limited relationship between the temperature and the heating used to keep the school warm.

              In general, the baseload should not vary between days of the week and between weekdays and weekends.

            <p>
              If there is a big variation, find out what is causing the baseload to be higher on certain days of the week, and switch off the equipment or lights causing the difference.
