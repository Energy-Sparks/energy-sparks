-- This query is used to find data issues by looking for anomalies in validated electricity meter readings
--
-- Anomalies are defined as sudden changes in baseload, e.g. a large daily change or drop to zero.
-- This type of anomaly can be used to identify meter data issues or the installation of a solar array
--
-- The query does all of the baseload calculations from the underlying half-hourly data, applying alternate
-- rules depending on whether the meter is associated with solar panels (with either metered or estimated data)
--
-- The query is built from four CTEs that build on each other to fetch and calculate the baseload with the
-- final comparison done in the SELECT query at the end
--
-- It returns the id of the amr_validated_reading with the anomalous reading, along with the meter_id, reading_date
-- and the calculated baseload for that and the previous day.
--
-- The SQL is commented, but to summarise:
--
-- unnested_readings_with_index -
--   selects the amr_validated_readings, unnesting the 48 half-hourly readings so there is a row
--   per reading, it includes the index of the reading in the original array
--
-- unnested_readings_with_index_and_ranking
--   calculates an additional index for each half-hourly reading, lowest first. Either the original
--   array index or this order is used when calculating the baseload
--
-- daily_baseload
--   calculates the baseload, switching between two different methods depending on whether the
--   meter has a solar array
--
-- last_two_days_baseload
--   brings together each days readings with the day before
--
-- The final SELECT statement then selects from with_prev_day to identify the anomalies.
--
-- An anomaly is: a drop to near zero (0.0--0.01), where the previous day is not a negligible value. Or there has
-- just been a large drop in baseload (change by x5)

-- Join the amr_validated_readings to the meters table
