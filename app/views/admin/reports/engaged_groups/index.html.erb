<h1>Engaged Groups</h1>
<p>
  The table below lists "engaged schools" for each school group. An engaged school has done one of the following since
  the start of the current academic year (<%= nice_dates(AcademicYear.current.start_date) %>):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Recorded a pupil activity or adult action, set a target, started a programme, received an audit, recorded some
    temperatures or run a transport survey
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>OR</b> had at least one school or pupil user login to the application. Users need to log in to use the above
    features, but some users may log in but not otherwise engage with that functionality, by including logged in visits
    in our list of engaged schools we can more better track 'silent' users and schools.
  </li>
</ul>
