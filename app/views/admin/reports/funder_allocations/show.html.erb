<h1>Funder school count</h1>

<h2>Funded schools</h2>

<p>
  This table summarises the number of visible and data enabled schools for each funder, along with a count of
  schools which have no funder assigned.
</p>
<p>
  Visible schools have finished onboarding, but do not yet have their data enabled. Funders are either directly linked
  to schools or via their school group.

<h1>Funder allocation report</h1>

<p>
  Generates a report designed to support allocating schools across potential funders. The report includes all
  active schools as well as those that have been archived.
</p>

<p>
  Active schools includes all schools that are either still in the process of onboarding, or have completed onboarding.
  So this report will include more schools than are shown in the above table.
