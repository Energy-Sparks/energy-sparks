<h1>Energy tariffs overview</h1>

<p>
The following table summarises the energy tariffs currently configured in the system.
</p>

<p>
 It only counts tariffs that are currently enabled and in-use. As well as a count
 of how many tariffs for each school group, it lists how many schools in those groups
 have their own tariffs, either manually entered or imported via their smart meters.
