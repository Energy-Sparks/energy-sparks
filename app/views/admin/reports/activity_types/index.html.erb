  This table provides some high-level insights into our pupil activities. Use the table header
  to sort the rows and click on an individual activity for more detail.
</p>

<p>
  Those highlighted in <span class="bg-warning">yellow</span> have been marked as not active and are no longer visible to users.

<p>
  The <strong>Recorded</strong> columns reports the number of times the activity has ever been recorded, and
  the number of unique schools that have recorded it.
</p>

<p>
  The <strong>Referenced</strong> columns show how many types the activity is referenced as a "Suggested next activity" via another activity, the number of programmes in which it is included, the number of times it is referenced from "Find out more" pages, and the number of audits that reference it.
