<h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
<p>Transport accounts for around one-fifth of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Some modes of transport, emit more carbon than others! For example, petrol or diesel cars emit, on average, about 3 times more than electric cars. Some modes emit no carbon whatsoever - can you guess what they are? Find out how much carbon your school community uses by travelling to school.</p>
