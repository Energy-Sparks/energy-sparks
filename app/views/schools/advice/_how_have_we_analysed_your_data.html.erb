<strong>Energy data</strong>

For pages with a single fuel type (which is all except the Total Energy Use):

Calculations based on %{fuel_type} consumed between %{start_date} and %{end_date}

Where start/end are dates for aggregate meter

For total energy use:

A table with 2 columns:
fuel type and aggregated meter date range
one row per fuel type, with start/end dates of the aggregate meter

Title: School characteristics

The following characteristics are used when analysing your school energy data. Temperature compensation uses weather data specific to your school's location.

A table with 2 columns:

Characteristic
Value

And then rows for:

floor area, with value of: floor area m2
location, with value of: postcode (lat/long)
pupils, with value of number of pupils
type, with value of school type

Title: Cost calculations

Consumption costs are estimated based on historic tariff information
Future savings are estimates based on your school's latest tariff information
Potential cost savings quoted in school comparisons, e.g. for comparable "well managed" and "exemplar" schools are also based on your school's current tariffs

If a schools’ tariffs have changed recently:

Your electricity tariffs have changed in the last year, the last change was on %{date}, before this date the average tariff was XXXp/kWh, and since it is £YYYY/kWh. This will increase your electricity costs by ZZZZ% going forwards. Cost calculations used for most charts and analysis do not include standing charges except for the more accurate bill validation information presented on the Cost analysis page. .

Title: School comparisons

School comparisons are based on benchmarking your school against comparable schools based on the characteristics outlined below.

"Exemplar" schools represent the top 17.5% of Energy Sparks schools
"Well managed" schools represent the top 30% of Energy Sparks schools
