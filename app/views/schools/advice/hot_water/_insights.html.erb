Title:  What do we mean by hot water gas use?

Hot water in schools is generally provided by a central gas boiler which then continuously circulates the hot water in a loop around the school. Sometimes these gas-based systems are supplemented by more local electrically powered immersion or point of use heaters.

This section of the dashboard analyses the efficiency of your school's hot water usage and the potential savings from either improving the timing control of your existing hot water system or replacing it completely with point of use electric hot water systems.
