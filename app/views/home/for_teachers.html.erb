      <h2>Pupil's dashboard</h2>
      <p><strong>Energy Sparks has a separate dashboard designed for school pupils, which presents energy information in a more pupil friendly manner.</strong></p>

      <p>The content is focused on encouraging pupils to actively engage in promoting energy saving in the school and take part in energy saving activities. The dashboard aims to provide them with a greater understanding of energy and climate change.</p>

      <p>Energy facts are introduced to help pupils understand the energy, monetary or climate impact of energy use within their school.</p>

      <p>Support for pupils is provided in designing and carrying out experiments to monitor energy related data and behaviour patterns at school.</p>
