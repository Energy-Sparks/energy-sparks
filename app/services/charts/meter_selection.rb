module Charts
  # Encapsulates presenting a list of meters used to populate a select box for driving a MeterSelectionChartComponent
  #
  # Produces a list of objects that can be used to populate a select box using +options_from_collection_for_select+
  #
  # Also produces a hash of meters to date ranges that can be used to produce chart titles and subtitles that describe
  # the date ranges being shown on the chart.
  #
  # By default it will include all meters for the given fuel type that have readings. But supports options for
  # further filtering of the list of meters via the +filter+ option. Any meter for which the filter returns true will
  # be dropped from the list.
  #
  # Some charts include an option to show data for the entire school as well as individual meters. This can be configured
  # via the +include_whole_school+ option.
  #
  # The date ranges produced by +date+ranges_by_meter+ can be restricted using +date_window+
  #
  # Currently this class uses the meters returned from a MeterCollection rather than querying for meters from
  # the database.
