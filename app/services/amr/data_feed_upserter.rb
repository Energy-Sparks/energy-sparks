  class DataFeedUpserter
    # This is used to specify the update clause for when we are merging into existing
    # data rather than just replacing.
    #
    # The clause needs to specify all columns that will be updated when a duplicate is
    # found during the upsert
    #
    # In a Postgres upsert statement the new data is referenced via a set called "excluded"
    # So the new readings to be inserted can be referenced as "excluded.readings"
    #
    # We define this update clause to provide logic that defines how to create the array of
    # updated readings to be stored in the database
    #
    # The query uses the set returning function generate_series to generate indexes
    # for the array (1..48). The single column returned by that set is aliased as i.
    #
    # The new array to be inserted is created using the array_agg function
    # and a CASE statement. The CASE statement essentially iterates over each array entry
    # to decide how to merge the values, returning one row per entry. The array_agg function
    # then turns those rows into a single array value.
    #
    # The logic in the CASE statement is that if we have missing entries in the data
    # to be inserted then we will merge that with the currently saved array. Otherwise
    # the new values overwrite anything already stored.
    #
    # This allows new data to override anything already in the system, but where we have
    # partial days, we end up with a merged array.
    #
    # Postgres has no built in functions to do this type of array merging. This approach also
    # avoids having to declare a custom function
    #
    # For all the other columns we just take the values from the incoming data.
