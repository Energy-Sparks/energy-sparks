  # Used to organise and validate the relationships between School and SchoolGroup
  #
  # There will be at most one "organisation" relationship between a School and a
  # SchoolGroup. Equivalent to a has_one relationship.
  #
  # There may be many "area" and "project" relationships.
  #
  # The types of SchoolGroup that can participate in those relationships is also
  # restricted. "organisation" relationships are limited to "general", "local_authority",
  # and "multi_academy_trust" group types.
  #
  # "project" roles can only refer to "project" SchoolGroups. The remaining
  # SchoolGroup types are restricted to "area" relationships.
