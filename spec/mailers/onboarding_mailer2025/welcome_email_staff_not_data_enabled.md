# Thank you for confirming your Energy Sparks user account.

We have now set up your Energy Sparks account and soon you will be able to use it to see how much energy your school is using and find out about the greatest energy saving opportunities based on your current energy use.

We are currently working to get energy data for your school and will let you know when it becomes available.

You have been set up with a staff account. If you think you might need to check and update school details, you will need an admin account.

In the meantime, here is our quick guide for making the most of your Energy Sparks account:

1. Familiarise yourself with using Energy Sparks, we have [lots of useful guidance and information about training](http://localhost/intervention_types/74).
2. Build an energy saving team: [consider setting up a student team](http://localhost/activity_types/33) to lead on energy efficiency at your school and help them to [find their energy allies](http://localhost/activity_types/174). They can start using our educational activities straight away. Watch our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tTpe2ur67k&list=PLMAAPNnPXGlyu8fqhXjrZgLDduHDzBIca&index=9) on how to record activities.
3. Set up a holiday switch off routine: On average, 15% of schools' energy is used during the holidays. Creating a holiday switch-off checklist and running through the list at the end of term is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to reduce energy bills, even for schools with holiday clubs. We have some [example switch-off checklists](http://localhost/intervention_types/71) available for you to use.
4. Sign up to energy saving alerts and messages: Our alert system has helped some schools save thousands of pounds by notifying them about expected changes in their energy use. You can also receive regular tips and updates to help your school make the most of its Energy Sparks account throughout the year. [Change your email preferences here.](http://localhost/profiles)

We will be in touch shortly to confirm when we have completed getting access to your energy data.

We hope Energy Sparks will empower your pupils, school staff, and wider school community to take action to make your school more energy efficient.
