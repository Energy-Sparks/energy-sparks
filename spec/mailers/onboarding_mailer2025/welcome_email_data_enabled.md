# Thank you for confirming your Energy Sparks user account.

You can now use Energy Sparks to see how much energy your school is using, find out about the greatest energy saving opportunities and explore our activities and educational resources designed to teach your pupils about energy whilst saving money for their school.

Here is our quick guide for making the most of your Energy Sparks account:

1. **Familiarise yourself** with using Energy Sparks, we have [lots of useful guidance and information about training](http://localhost/intervention_types/74).
2. **Find your biggest energy saving opportunities:** we analyse your energy data and help you prioritise the action you take to reduce your costs and carbon dioxide emissions. [Find these here](http://localhost/schools/test-school/advice/priorities).
3. **Build an energy saving team:** consider [setting up a student team](http://localhost/activity_types/33) to lead on energy efficiency at your school and help them to [find their energy allies](http://localhost/activity_types/174). They can start using our educational activities straight away. Watch our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tTpe2ur67k&list=PLMAAPNnPXGlyu8fqhXjrZgLDduHDzBIca&index=9) on how to record activities.
4. **Set up a holiday switch off routine:** On average, 15% of schools' energy is used during the holidays. Creating a holiday switch-off checklist and running through the list at the end of term is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to reduce energy bills, even for schools with holiday clubs. We have some [example switch-off checklists](http://localhost/intervention_types/71) available for you to use.
5. **Sign up to energy saving alerts and messages:** Our alert system has helped some schools save thousands of pounds by notifying them about expected changes in their energy use. You can also receive regular tips and updates to help your school make the most of its Energy Sparks account throughout the year. [Change your email preferences here.](http://localhost/profiles)

We hope Energy Sparks will empower your pupils, school staff, and wider school community to take action to make your school more energy efficient.
