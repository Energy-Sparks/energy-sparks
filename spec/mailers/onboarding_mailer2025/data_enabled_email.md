We are pleased to inform you that energy consumption data is now available on your Energy Sparks account. You can use Energy Sparks to [see how much energy your school is using](http://localhost/schools/test-school).

Please note: MyText

We estimate that your highest priority energy saving opportunity is to a thing has happened. Doing this could save you as much as £1 and 1kg CO₂ per year.

You have been set up with a staff account. If you think you might need to check and update school details, you will need an admin account.

Here is our quick guide for making the most of your Energy Sparks account:

1. **Familiarise yourself** with using Energy Sparks, we have [lots of useful guidance and information about training](http://localhost/intervention_types/74).
2. **Find your biggest energy saving opportunities:** we analyse your energy data and help you prioritise the action you take to reduce your costs and carbon dioxide emissions. [Find these here](http://localhost/schools/test-school/advice/priorities).
3. **Build an energy saving team:** consider [setting up a student team](http://localhost/activity_types/33) to lead on energy efficiency at your school and help them to [find their energy allies](http://localhost/activity_types/174). They can start using our educational activities straight away. Watch our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tTpe2ur67k&list=PLMAAPNnPXGlyu8fqhXjrZgLDduHDzBIca&index=9) on how to record activities.
4. **Set up a holiday switch off routine:** On average, 15% of schools' energy is used during the holidays. Creating a holiday switch-off checklist and running through the list at the end of term is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to reduce energy bills, even for schools with holiday clubs. We have some [example switch-off checklists](http://localhost/intervention_types/71) available for you to use.
5. **Sign up to energy saving alerts and messages:** Our alert system has helped some schools save thousands of pounds by notifying them about expected changes in their energy use. You can also receive regular tips and updates to help your school make the most of its Energy Sparks account throughout the year. [Change your email preferences here.](http://localhost/profiles)

Below are a few other things that might help you when using Energy Sparks:

**Set your first energy-saving targets**

You can set targets for reducing your energy consumption. We'll provide you with reports to help you monitor your progress, a recommended set of activities that will engage the whole school, and additional insights through our detailed analysis of your energy usage.

Not sure what's achievable? We've suggested an initial target based on our successes working with schools across the country.

**School holidays**

**On average, 15% of schools' energy is used during the holidays.** Creating a holiday switch-off checklist and running through the list at the end of term is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to reduce energy bills, even for schools with holiday clubs. We have some [example switch-off checklists](http://localhost/intervention_types/71) available for you to use.

**Staff training**

If you would like to receive further training on how to use Energy Sparks effectively at your school, you can sign up to one of our virtual induction sessions via [our website](http://localhost/training). Staff can also watch our pre-recorded introductory videos available at [https://www.youtube.com/@energysparksuk](https://www.youtube.com/@energysparksuk).

**Adding additional users**

To encourage your colleagues to get involved with Energy Sparks, you can set them up with a user account on Energy Sparks. We encourage all schools to have at least 3 staff with user accounts. To add your colleagues, click [here](http://localhost/schools/test-school/users). Enter their details and they will be issued with an account set-up email.

**Update your opening hours to include after-school activities and any lettings**

At the moment Energy Sparks is basing its analysis on school opening times of to . These should be the times when the pupils are arriving and leaving the school. This should be when the school is fully operational with the majority of pupils in school. Before and after school clubs can be included if the majority of the school is in use by pupils. External lettings or times when you have only a small proportion of your school estate in use by pupils should be listed under community use times.

Many schools will have cleaning or other premises staff in the school outside of the times when they are open to pupils. Do not include these periods in your main school opening hours as we recommend that you should keep energy use to a minimum during these times.

To set up your school opening hours, click [here](http://localhost/schools/test-school/times/edit).

**Record your activities**

There are [over 140 activities](http://localhost/activity_categories) on the Energy Sparks site for you to do with your students. Once you've completed an activity, don't forget to [record it](http://localhost/activity_categories) on your Energy Sparks account. We also have [lots of adult-led energy-saving actions](http://localhost/intervention_type_groups). You can [record adult-led actions](http://localhost/intervention_type_groups) on Energy Sparks and you'll gain points for them too. As you gain points, you'll move up the Energy Sparks [scoreboard](http://localhost/scoreboards). Each year we have exciting scoreboard prizes for the top scoring schools.

**Thanks for joining!**

I wish you the best of luck on your energy-saving journey. If you have any questions, I'll be happy to help.

Many thanks
