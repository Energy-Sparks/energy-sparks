<p><strong><em>We’re into the final winter push &#8211; longer days and warmer nights are on the horizon, and soon we will be switching our heating off for the summer. But for now the heating is still on, so let’s look at how to reduce heating waste as much as possible.</em></strong></p>



<p>If you&#8217;re reading this, you may already know that Energy Sparks works with schools to help them reduce their gas and electricity use. We do this by analysing a school&#8217;s energy consumption data and providing bespoke insights and suggested actions to help them reduce energy costs and carbon emissions. The average reduction in energy use achieved by Energy Sparks schools last year was 10%, while the schools that made the biggest improvements achieved annual energy savings of 40%.</p>



<p>We believe that the whole school community has a role to play in energy saving and climate action, so we also provide a <a href="https://energysparks.uk/activity_categories">range of activities and teaching resources</a> (as well as a special pupil dashboard for Energy Sparks schools) that allow young people to develop key skills while making a real-world difference for the climate.</p>



<p>Through our work with schools, we have identified a number of common heating issues that are relatively straightforward to solve, and which can help schools cut their energy bills and carbon footprint. </p>



<p>Below, we explore two common heating issues and how you can solve them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to set the right temperature at your school</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;DfE recommends&nbsp;that schools have a set temperature of 18°C for normal classrooms. If temperatures are set too high, it not only means that more energy will be used during the day to keep rooms up to temperature, but also that your heating will likely come on earlier and heat for longer periods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, we often find that&nbsp;if temperatures are set too high people will start opening windows to cool rooms down, throwing money straight out of the window!</p>



<p>To help schools tackle this, we have designed a programme of activities called <strong><a href="https://energysparks.uk/programme_types/15">Smart schools stay at 18 degrees</a></strong>.<strong> </strong>This programme helps staff and pupils work together to investigate what is happening at their school and adjust heating settings as needed. You don&#8217;t need gas data or even an Energy Sparks account to run this programme in your school.</p>



<p>We have also put together some <a href="https://energysparks.uk/intervention_types/10">guidance about the best temperatures for other school areas</a>, such as corridors and sports halls.</p>

</div>



<div style="height:21px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to stop heating coming on too early</h2>



<p>Another major issue for schools is the heating coming on too early in the morning (<a href="https://blog.energysparks.uk/what-are-the-main-reasons-for-school-heating-coming-on-too-early-in-the-morning/">read about why this happens</a>).</p>



<p>Our <strong><a href="https://energysparks.uk/programme_types/17">Give your heating a lie-in</a></strong> programme<strong>&nbsp;</strong>helps schools tackle this issue. The programme shows you how to use Energy Sparks to identify if your heating isn’t doing what you expect. </p>



<p><strong>But how can you tell if your heating is coming on too early in the mornings?</strong></p>



<p>Well, if your school is signed up to Energy Sparks then we can help! <strong>We conduct heating start-time analysis</strong>, which can be found on your&nbsp;heating control advice page*.</p>



<p>The table below shows an example where a school could have saved up to £62 in a single day by switching their heating on later. We also estimate savings over a whole year if our advice is followed.&nbsp;The heating control advice&nbsp;page includes charts that show the distribution of gas consumption during school days, which can help determine how well controlled the timing of the boiler is.</p>



<p>Note that if your school has underfloor heating it may take a few hours longer to warm up, but it still does not need to be on 24 hours a day.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get inspired!</h2>



<p>St John&#8217;s CofE Primary School and Nursery in Belper&nbsp;joined Energy Sparks in the summer of 2024 and is working with Derbyshire Council and their Let’s Go Zero Climate Advisor to improve the energy efficiency of the school.</p>



<p>The school has quite a complex site, with lots of connected buildings and a number of boilers. Controlling each boiler separately and making changes to their settings can be quite a challenge. However, when the headteacher saw the potential holiday savings, he was inspired to take on this challenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the last two holidays &#8211; Christmas and February half-term &#8211; the head has used the school’s gas data on Energy Sparks to improve holiday heating settings and track savings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The boilers are set to frost protection only at the end of term and, if needed, the head comes into school before the end of the holidays to get term-time settings back on and the school warm and ready. </p>



<p>The savings speak for themselves: during the Christmas holidays, gas consumption was down by 45% compared to the previous year, while in February half-term it was down by 33% despite colder temperatures. <strong>Over those three weeks of holidays, the school saved £700 and over a tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is no secret that schools across the UK are under unprecedented financial strain. With energy prices predicted to rise again in 2025, the cost of heating and powering buildings and equipment is eating into schools’ already over-stretched budgets, diverting funding that could be better spent on pupils.</p>



<p>But there is some good news for despairing leaders. Energy Sparks has <a href="https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Energy-Efficiency-in-School-2023_24.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Energy-Efficiency-in-School-2023_24.pdf">published a new report</a> that highlights four changes schools can make to save thousands of pounds each year. Most of these changes come at no (or minimal) cost, and do not require any capital investment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What can schools expect to save?</h2>



<p>Energy Sparks provides a unique tool that allows schools to see half-hourly energy usage and provides tailored analysis and insights that make it straightforward for school managers to understand what action needs to be taken to reduce energy costs and carbon emissions. Our platform is designed to be easy for both busy school staff and pupils to use, and we also provide related <a href="https://energysparks.uk/activity_categories">activities that teachers can use to engage their pupils</a> in energy saving and climate action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the academic year 2023/24, the average savings made by a primary school signed up with Energy Sparks was £5,000 and 7 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> while the average saving for a secondary school was £21,000 and 26 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>



<p>We estimate that £7,000,000 and 8,500 tonnes of CO<sub>2 </sub>were saved across all of our schools in 2023/24 &#8211; that’s the same amount of carbon dioxide as flying 810 times around the world.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Energy Sparks’ four tips for cutting energy costs</h2>



<p>Using analysis from our unique national energy database for schools, coupled with insights from staff at partner schools, we offer the following advice for all schools and Multi-Academy Trusts looking to make savings:</p>



<p><strong>1. Understand your energy use</strong></p>



<p>Schools should ensure they have half-hourly meters fitted for gas and electricity supplies so that they can understand their energy use. Metering contracts also need to include half-hourly data provision to the customer or their ‘appointed third party’ (such as Energy Sparks, which then uses the data to provide bespoke insights). The additional cost of a metering upgrade can be paid back very quickly &#8211; within a few days for a large secondary school. Access to energy data allows schools to identify when energy is being used, investigate out of hours gas and electricity consumption and look into any unexpected peaks.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-fill"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-black-color has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="https://energysparks.uk/campaigns/book-demo">Book a demo</a></div>
</div>



<div style="height:46px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>2. Reduce out of hours energy consumption</strong></p>



<p>Short days and long holidays mean that schools are generally only open to pupils for approximately 15% of the year. Yet the Energy Sparks database shows that well over half of a typical school’s energy is used outside of school hours.</p>



<p>We therefore recommend <a href="https://energysparks.uk/intervention_types/71">creating checklists</a> for switching lights and appliances off overnight, at weekends and at the end of term. Leaders should also make sure that it is someone’s responsibility to switch things off and perform spot checks.</p>



<p>Schools signed up with Energy Sparks can see charts that show their out-of-hours energy use, and can compare their performance with other schools. They also receive reminders and alerts to help them reduce out-of-hours energy use.</p>



<div class="wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-fill"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-black-color has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="https://energysparks.uk/intervention_types/14"><strong>FEATURED ACTION: Start a whole-school switch off campaign</strong></a></div>
</div>



<div style="height:46px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>3. Check systems, timings and controls&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Introducing and improving timers and controls is a very cheap way to reduce energy consumption. Energy Sparks recommends:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Checking whether gas use matches expectations. Are boiler settings doing what they are supposed to?&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://energysparks.uk/intervention_types/11">Adjusting timings</a> &#8211; if the heating is coming on more than two hours before school begins, try experimenting with a later start time and checking classroom temperatures when pupils begin to arrive. Also make sure that heating switches off before the school is fully closed, as it should stay warm for a few hours.&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://energysparks.uk/intervention_types/26">Checking that frost protection is set and working</a>. This will protect pipes and buildings without the need to keep heating and water on at all times during cold weather.</li>



<li>Adding seven-day timers to storage heaters, water boilers, <a href="https://energysparks.uk/intervention_types/47">printers and other appliances</a> so that they switch off at the end of the day and turn on again automatically the next day.</li>



<li>Checking the placement of thermostats &#8211; if these are located in drafty locations such as corridors, you may end up with heating that remains on unnecessarily, even though classrooms are too warm.</li>



<li>Introducing an automatic <a href="https://energysparks.uk/intervention_types/33">shut down of networked ICT equipment</a>, but not an automatic switch on in the morning.</li>



<li>Ensuring that <a href="https://energysparks.uk/intervention_types/73">estate staff receive adequate training</a> and handover when new heating systems or building energy management systems are installed.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>4. Empower your pupils</strong></p>



<p>Allow and encourage your pupils to switch lighting and equipment off when not needed. Build their analytical and investigative skills using real-life data and examples within lessons to demonstrate the difference they can make to their school and the world around them. Energy Sparks <a href="https://energysparks.uk/activity_categories">offers a wealth of free teaching resources</a> for schools that want to involve their pupils in energy saving and climate action.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Policy implications</h2>



<p>Under the Department for Education’s <em>Sustainability and climate change strategy for education</em>, schools are required to have a dedicated sustainability lead and a climate action plan in place by the end of this year. </p>



<p>But Energy Sparks CEO Dr Claudia Towner says she is concerned that a lack of data insights and a focus on large capital investments means that easy wins are being missed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What our experience shows is that any school can start to make changes right away, and that seemingly small changes to boiler settings or switching off electrical equipment outside of school hours can add up to significant savings.”</p>



<p>The charity’s findings are significant at a national level too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Given what we know about out of hours energy use, <strong>we estimate that across the UK, schools spent </strong><strong>an estimated £900 million</strong><strong> on heating and powering schools when they were closed to pupils</strong>,” continues Dr Towner.</p>



<p>A real barrier for many schools is the inability to access their half-hourly meter data. This should be provided free of charge to all public sector organisations upon request; however, Energy Sparks says that not all energy suppliers are providing this service. “Without this level of insight, schools are having to play a guessing game as to whether their heating and electricity systems are working as they ought to be,” says Dr Towner.</p>



<p>More generally, she feels that more could be done to support schools to make the simple changes outlined in Energy Sparks’ report. “Providing funding for all schools to better understand and optimise their heating systems, and for them to access an energy insights tool like Energy Sparks would allow sustainability leads to be effective, and would free up staff time as well as vital funds that would be far better spent on pupils,” she concludes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We often get asked by school leaders and estates teams how much they could save by upgrading their lighting to LEDs and if there’s a way to tell from their Energy Sparks account how much of their electricity use is down to lighting.</p>



<p>We’ve asked school energy expert and founder of <strong>Inspired Efficiency, Matt Fulford</strong> for his take on this and here’s what he has to say:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rule of thumb savings</h2>



<p>Replacing old inefficient lighting for LED lighting is usually an excellent energy saving measure but trying to accurately assess the amount of energy that will be saved is important to have the confidence to invest. Different light fittings will save different amounts. For example, a single 5ft fluorescent tube will be 58W and an LED replacement will be around 25W saving 57%. A square light fitting in a suspended ceiling is typically made up of four 18W tubes totalling 72W but is replaced with a single LED panel light of around 23W saving 68%.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>If a school has mostly older, inefficient lighting then <strong>typically around 40% of the school’s annual electricity consumption will be for lighting</strong> &#8211; the lighting load. For a whole school lighting upgrade, it is normal to save around 40% to 60% of this lighting load.<strong> So as a quick rule of thumb, the likely saving from installing LED lighting is around half of that lighting load (40%), so about 20% of the school’s total electricity use.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can we calculate potential savings?</h2>



<p>LED lighting companies will usually work out the savings but it&#8217;s good to be able to check that these have not been incorrectly presented. Using the initial rule of thumb above will be a suitable quick check. If the savings presented are a long way apart from this, it is worth doing your own calculations.</p>



<p>The most accurate way to calculate the energy saving from lighting is to survey each type of fitting to review what lamps (bulbs) are within each fitting, the wattage of the lamps, how many lamps are in the fittings and how many fittings there are of each type. Then find out what a suitable replacement lamp would be for each fitting and the wattage of the replacement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to work out how much electricity is being used, you will also need to know how long the lights are on over a year. Working on the basis of the lights being on from 7am to 5pm, Monday to Friday for 40 weeks of the year, a school will have its lights on for 2000 hours a year. In reality the lights may be off some times during the day but on for cleaning, parents evenings etc so 2,000 hours is typically fairly accurate for primary schools and 2,200 is fairly typical for secondary schools.</p>



<p>So multiplying the wattage of all of the current lights by the number of hours they will be used will give you the number of kWh (remember to divide by 1,000 to go from W to kW). Compare that with the same for the new lights and you will be able to see the savings.</p>



<p>If the savings presented by the company are still very different, it is worth checking what hours have been used and that these are realistic and also that the rate of the cost of electricity is the same as the rate that is currently charged on the electricity bills.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>Energy Sparks has a pupil activity to <a href="https://energysparks.uk/activity_types/160">conduct a lighting audit</a> as part of our <a href="https://energysparks.uk/programme_types/18">Lower your Lighting Impact Programme</a>. Staff and students could use this to estimate potential savings from a lighting upgrade.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can we make the most savings?</h2>



<p>Savings can be maximised by ensuring that the specification of the new LED lighting is as good as it can be with the lowest wattage LED fittings being selected. LED lights tend to provide more light output than older fluorescent fittings so making sure that any new installation avoids the room being over lit will maximise savings. It is also good to check whether it is necessary to use the same amount of light fittings as are currently installed as it is not always necessary to replace lighting on a 1:1 basis. As a basic rule of thumb, LED panel lights in a suspended ceiling can have three solid square ceiling tiles between each light fitting in both directions.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>And don’t forget that you can use your Energy Sparks account to gain a better understanding of the cost of your lighting before embarking on a lighting project.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How can Energy Sparks help us assess the cost of our lighting?</h2>



<p>Use the energy efficiency advice pages, accessed by clicking on the &#8220;<strong>Explore energy data</strong>&#8221; button on the <strong>Adult dashboard</strong> to inspect your electricity consumption in more detail.</p>



<p>The chart below comes from the <strong>Intraday </strong>analysis page, and shows the electricity consumption through an average day at a school with inefficient lighting. As soon as people start arriving at the school and switching lights on, consumption is high and remains high until the end of the day. This school has since upgraded the lighting and reduced electricity consumption by over 30%</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf6TBBs4kIeCK-aU6fXE4Q2YXTgYNbckDi9xw8uV2X7SYYTNqXo__27HE9dmbh1iMxL3DMsTnfwcit3RB08JtsXu-w08GSlwqNEMmUO5YPeseOpktbopocUmjDudCXXDby3vLwNbXGxlyqgEmz_SfBcx69Q?key=gaR8HYyMMsNwrLEz0uI0jg" style="width: 850px;"></p>



<p>The following chart is from the <strong>Baseload </strong>analysis page shows a school’s electricity consumption on a Sunday when the school is empty. The dip in consumption in the middle of the day shows that the school’s security lighting that is on overnight is using a lot of energy. We estimated that this school is spending £4,000 a year on electricity for their security lighting. Replacing with LEDs and adding motion sensors could save them money, alert people to intruders and keep their neighbours happier.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcdQ-ADc_xLYdosGFmhZDp6SDt7Z56NDnA5d3_rLvOcqhr-D6pANWgxZaXNjBa87y39in7NeceCp_aOd-KggDE63GWSTpIwAyQO4tGSqehEwoWFLPXN1a_cW0ZsH26KV8uF1EJmhvI--5UfE8P0jdrT0a-P?key=gaR8HYyMMsNwrLEz0uI0jg" style="width: 850px;"></p>



<p>Finally, we have an example of a school with inefficient flood lighting on their playing field. We have estimated that lighting their pitch costs them approximately £6,000 a year. The school have had similar estimates from a lighting company and are expecting to save £4,000 a year once their upgrade project is complete. The project will include dimmable lights in accordance with Football Association guidance which will also save them money.</p>

<p>This is me, last month. I was cycling home from a school I visited for work along a cycle path that opened earlier this year. A path that was created by my former colleagues at my Local Authority. This was a good day.</p>



<p>This week is Green Careers Week, so I thought I would write up a little about how I got where I am now and what it means to me to have what I consider a green career. I have always been fascinated by the routes people take through their working lives &#8211; the decisions they have to make and the changes in direction they might take. I think it&#8217;s really helpful for people starting out, or considering a change, to know what other people have done. So here we go.</p>



<p>At school I was fairly bright &#8211; good at most things, not brilliant at anything. I enjoyed maths and science and those were going to be my best grades although I also liked drama and design technology (although not the planning bit, just the making). I told my careers adviser I was going to do maths at university because I was good at it. She said that was a terrible reason to do a subject and I should do something I loved, but I didn&#8217;t really have a subject I loved or a career I wanted. I only knew the jobs I could see around me &#8211; doctor, teacher, shop keeper etc.</p>



<p>So I did maths &#8211; for three months. I realised quite quickly (I think it might have been the imaginary numbers that did it for me), that I wanted to do something where I could see the purpose of doing it. I switched to Meteorology and Atmospheric Science. It still had a lot of maths and science in it, but also clouds and storms! Going to university was fantastic. It gave me independence, education, sport, friendship and ultimately my husband and career.</p>



<p>I used data for my dissertation &#8211; on the atmospheric dispersion of air pollution from the Buncefield fire in 2005 &#8211; from a company called AEA Technology. In a distracted moment while doing my research I found their graduate recruitment page and later applied. </p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="604" height="453" src="https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/464956541_10106555849683459_3742860827648330676_n.jpg" alt="This is me, at 23, graduating from the University of Leeds.

<p>AEA Technology went through many changes while I was there. By the time I left it was part of the engineering firm, Ricardo.  I worked with lots of people who were nationally and internationally known for their work so I learned a lot and made excellent friendships. I also got married, started a family and later relocated to the west country and worked from Ricardo&#8217;s Bristol office.   </p>



<p>Over the 13 years I was with Ricardo, I worked on forecasting air quality; reporting greenhouse gas emissions to the EU and UN; estimating the UK&#8217;s Local Authority CO2 emissions; updating the EU&#8217;s air pollutant emissions inventory guidance and advising local and national governments in the UK, Africa and Asia on how to estimate their emissions and build climate action plans. </p>



<p>Prompted by the IPCC&#8217;s special report on 1.5C warming in 2019, I decided that I wanted to have a more active role in climate, rather than just measuring and reporting emissions. I offered my time to my local council to help them with their new net zero goal, then soon after that they advertised for a climate emergency project manager.  It seemed like the perfect next step. </p>



<p>While it&#8217;s not always the most thankful of tasks, I would recommend that everyone work in the public sector for at least some of their lives. It gave me a much better appreciation and understanding of where my taxes go, why my vote matters and how difficult decisions are made. In my role, I worked with people from every part of the council &#8211; social services, libraries, highways, planning, housing, councillors, directors, even the CEO. I delivered Carbon Literacy Training to over 200 people, which helped build my understanding of how everything worked and their understanding of climate change and their role in acting on it. Being the second council in the whole country to receive a silver Carbon Literacy award was a very proud moment for me. </p>



<p>This was an incredibly varied role, although the pandemic hit a month in and changed things significantly. I still worked with local businesses and community groups; attended workshops about the regeneration of town centres; developed decarbonisation plans for council buildings; shared ideas with other local councils; we even ran an art competition about imagining a net zero future for North Somerset (see <a href="https://www.instagram.com/picture_this_art_competition_/">https://www.instagram.com/picture_this_art_competition_/</a>).</p>



<p>After 2.5 years at North Somerset Council, I felt that I had got plans in place and an excellent team, so I passed that role onto someone with much more council experience who could turn those plans into reality. My current role at Energy Sparks came up just at the right time and it felt like a wonderful balance between doing and influencing, with a generous sprinkling of playing with numbers and charts thrown in!</p>



<p>Now I&#8217;m working with schools to reduce their energy consumption and therefore their greenhouse gas emissions and energy bills. I spend an awful lot of time interpreting graphs (it&#8217;s not rocket science but I&#8217;m still quite pleased that I&#8217;m pretty good at it). I spot when a school&#8217;s heating is coming on too early, or an appliance on a timer is using energy throughout the holidays. I alert schools to these sorts of issues and work with our team to continuously improve what we do.</p>



<p>In the two years since I joined Energy Sparks, I have visited lots of schools; run workshops and virtual energy audits; I have spoken at conferences (see image below) and delivered training. I love being able to alert schools to issues, help them find solutions and spot saving in their data within such short timescales. We&#8217;re able to see results within a week, where working on a regional or national scale it would take many years. Last year, the average saving made by an Energy Sparks school was over £5,000 and 7 tonnes of CO2. There are over 20,000 schools in this country &#8211; imagine the possibilities!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure what I would change if I started all over again. Although I cringe at small mistakes or things I might do differently every single day, I think the big things have generally worked out well (so maybe I need to let myself off on the small stuff).</p>



<p>When people say do what you love, I think I now realise that doesn&#8217;t have to be a huge career ambition like dreaming to be a vet or a pilot or to save the whales. It can just mean that you use skills and tools every day that you enjoy using. I now realise that I love working with numbers. It doesn&#8217;t have to be huge complex calculations, it can just be adding some things up, spotting patterns and finding meaning in those patterns. I could do what I do as an accountant, an economist, an engineer or a government statistician. But I&#8217;m able to use my skills to do something that I believe is useful to the world and the people around me. That is a green career.</p>

<p>The words here from David might not sound like the most inspirational of quotes but they’re music to my ears because these are things we say so often at Energy Sparks. One of the most useful things about seeing a school’s energy data in graphical form is finding out that energy use is high at unexpected times. And nothing we advise schools to do is anything extreme or special. Mainly, it is giving school staff the tools and the permission to try something different and see if it works.</p>



<p>This week we’ve created a <a href="https://energysparks.uk/case_studies/15/download?locale=en" data-type="link" data-id="https://energysparks.uk/case_studies/15/download?locale=en">case study</a> on the 40% reduction in gas consumption that Northampton Academy have made in their first year since joining Energy Sparks but I thought it was worth a blog post too. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="284" src="https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-1024x284.png" alt="" class="wp-image-224 img-fluid" srcset="https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-1024x284.png 1024w, https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-300x83.png 300w, https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-768x213.png 768w, https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2.png 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Northampton Academy is a large secondary school of 1,700 pupils in the East Midlands. They joined Energy Sparks in December 2022 and since then the site team has been working hard to reduce the school&#8217;s energy consumption.</p>



<p>As a former plumber and domestic energy assessor, Facilities Manager David was sceptical that Energy Sparks could show him anything he didn&#8217;t already know about the school&#8217;s heating and he wasn’t convinced that significant improvements could be made. </p>



<p>This is something that happens fairly often when schools first use Energy Sparks. We get told our data couldn’t possibly be right because it says the heating is on overnight or at weekends. Data used by Energy Sparks comes directly from smart meters via energy suppliers so this is what schools will be billed for. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="882" height="84" src="https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Alert-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-228 img-fluid" srcset="https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Alert-1.png 882w, https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Alert-1-300x29.png 300w, https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Alert-1-768x73.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" /></figure>



<p>However, when David received alerts from Energy Sparks about high gas use when the school was closed, he took the time to investigate what was happening. He found that, although it wasn’t clear from the Building Energy Management System (BEMS), the heating was set to be on for most of the weekend, with only a short break in the middle of each day. With no one in the school to check at these times, it was only when David saw the Energy Sparks gas use charts that he knew this was happening.</p>



<p>The chart below shows gas use during one week in November 2022. The gas on Sunday 20th November cost the school £270 and the temperature wasn&#8217;t low enough for the school to need any frost protection.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="540" src="https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Nov2022_Gas-1024x540.png" alt="" class="wp-image-229 img-fluid" srcset="https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Nov2022_Gas-1024x540.png 1024w, https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Nov2022_Gas-300x158.png 300w, https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Nov2022_Gas-768x405.png 768w, https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Nov2022_Gas.png 1142w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The school has underfloor heating which takes a long time to heat up but also retains heat well. The heating is now off for most of the weekend, with just a few hours on Sunday evenings to warm up the school for the week ahead. This has saved the school on average more than £200 each weekend. </p>



<p>Heating set temperatures were changed to reflect advice given on the Energy Sparks website. Using Energy Sparks gave David and his team the confidence to know what temperatures to set in different areas of the school and to educate room users about the reasons. He was able to use the Energy Sparks analysis to check on the impacts of the changes, particularly during the periods of adjustment and experimentation. </p>



<p>The charts below show comparisons between two days and two weeks, before and after the changes were made. We have selected weeks with very similar outdoor temperatures so the gas consumption shouldn&#8217;t be affected by temperature changes.  </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="536" src="https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/WeekComparison-1024x536.png" alt="" class="wp-image-230 img-fluid" srcset="https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/WeekComparison-1024x536.png 1024w, https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/WeekComparison-300x157.png 300w, https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/WeekComparison-768x402.png 768w, https://blog.energysparks.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/WeekComparison.png 1422w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>David has also noticed high electricity at unexpected times. Ventilation and extraction units were running constantly so these have now been reduced to school occupation times. External lighting times have also been reduced as Energy Sparks charts helped identify that these often came on automatically in the middle of the day.</p>



<p>For Northampton Academy, using Energy Sparks has helped the school to reduce their gas bill by £34,000 and saved 82 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> this year. But this isn’t where the school is going to stop. As well as continuing with newly formed habits, David plans to build energy efficiency into any refurbishments &#8211; he already has the approach of replacing circulatory hot water with electric point of use heaters whenever bathrooms are refurbished. The next big challenge &#8211; and one not to be underestimated &#8211; will be involving more people. If one David can do all this, what could be achieved by a whole school working together?</p>
